ULYSSES AND PENELOPE.</h3>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">On</span> the morning of August 14th, in this
last summer, Mr. Austin May alighted at
the little Cypress Street station of the Boston
&amp; Albany Railroad, and, accompanied
only by a swarthy and adroit valet, and a
very handsome St. Bernard dog, got into
the somewhat antiquated family &#8220;carryall&#8221;
which awaited him, and drove away. May
was a stranger to the man in charge of the
station, as well as to the wide-awake trio of
boys who made it a sort of club, their exchange
of gossip, and pleasure resort; and
thus his arrival was unnoticed and unrecorded,
though his last absence had extended
over a period of several years. It was a
most oppressive day; and what few human
beings were dressed and stirring made haste
to get beneath the dense foliage, or to plunge
into the numerous private-paths and shortcuts,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">[4]</span>
with which the suburb of Brookline is
provided; leaving the roads and their dust
undisturbed, except by the sedate progress
of the old carryall, which left behind it, suspended
in the air, an amazing quantity of
the same considering its speed, and quite
obscured the morning sun with its golden
cloud. Austin May might have been an entering
circus procession, and no one would
have found it out. Even the boys at the
station were sluggish, and indisposed to
&#8220;catch on&#8221; behind every train, much less
to give their particular attention to one undistinguished
stranger, with or without a
dog.</p>

<p>May lit a cigar, and the carryall and its
occupants lumbered along unheeded. The
road was walled in and roofed over by a
dense canopy of foliage borne by arching
American elms; and through its green
walls, dense as a lane in Jersey, only momentary
glimpses were to be had of shaven
lawns and quiet country-houses. When
they came to a gate, with high stone posts,
topped by an ancient pair of cannon-balls,
the carryall turned slowly in. A moment
after they had passed the screen of border<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">[5]</span>
foliage, May found himself in the midst of a
wide lawn and garden, open to the sunlight,
but rimmed upon all points of the compass
by a distant hedge of trees, so that no roads,
houses, thoroughfares, or other fields, were
visible. In the centre of this stood, with
much dignity, an elderly brick house, its
southern wall quite green with ivy. In
front of it was a large pavilion, some hundred
yards removed, low and stone-built,
rising without apparent purpose from the
side of an artificial pool of water, rimmed
with rich bands of lilies. May looked anxiously
for the pavilion, and, when he saw it,
sank back in his seat with a sigh of relief.</p>

<p>The carryall stopped before a broad,
white marble step at the front door; and
the Charon of the conveyance, known locally
as the &#8220;d&eacute;p&ocirc;t-man,&#8221; having dumped the one
leather trunk upon the step, stood looking
at the stranger contemplatively, as if his
own duties in this world were all fulfilled.</p>

<p>&#8220;How much?&#8221; said May.</p>

<p>&#8220;Twenty-five cents,&#8221; said the d&eacute;p&ocirc;t-man.</p>

<p>May pulled out a half-dollar. &#8220;No matter
about the change,&#8221; he added, as the d&eacute;p&ocirc;t-man
hitched up his vest, preparatory to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[6]</span>
fishing in his cavernous trousers for the
requisite quarter.</p>

<p>The d&eacute;p&ocirc;t-man changed his quid of tobacco,
and drove off without a word, the
downward lines from the corners of his
mouth a shade deeper, as if he profited unwillingly
by such unnecessary prodigality,
which aroused rather contempt than gratitude.
May waited until the carryall had
quite disappeared in the elm-trees, and then
rang the bell. Apparently, he expected no
prompt answer; for he sat down upon one
of the old china garden-seats, which flanked
the door, and rolled and lit a cigarette.
After a few minutes he rang again, louder;
the unwonted tinkle reverberated through
the closed house, and an imaginative man,
putting his ear to the key-hole, might have
heard the scuffle of the family ghosts as
they scurried back to their hiding-places.
At last an uncertain step was heard in the
hall, and after much turning of keys and
rattling of chains, the door was slowly
opened by an old woman, who blinked at
the flood of sudden light which poured in,
rebounded, eddied, and at last filled each
corner of the fine old hall.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">[7]</span>&#8220;Mrs. Eastman, I suppose?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s my name,&#8221; said the woman, in a
strong down-east accent.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am Mr. May,&#8221; said he.</p>

<p>The woman glared at him as before, and
did not compromise her dignity by a courtesy.
&#8220;Mr. Eastman got your letter,&#8221; said
she, &#8220;and I have got your room ready.
Will you go there now? I don&#8217;t know
who&#8217;s to carry up your trunk.&#8221;</p>

<p>May&#8217;s valet solved that difficulty by
shouldering the leather receptacle and carrying
it up himself. The room was large,
airy, and neatly kept. A straw matting was
on the floor, covered here and there with
well-worn rugs; and from about the windows
came a twittering of birds. All in it
indicated, not a new and modern house, but
the well-worn nest of a family that had been
born, had cried, laughed, played, made love,
and died, in every room. Yet there was no
evidence of recent occupation; the room
was innocent of those last touches which are
the pride of the feminine housekeeper; curtains,
splashers, anti-macassars, were few;
and no twilled, frilled, or pleated things infested
the windows, and impeded the entry<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[8]</span>
of the outer air. May opened the door of
a large closet; it was empty, save for a
broad, white, chip hat of prehistoric fashion,
and ribbons of faded rose-color; but,
if it had belonged to a daughter of the
house, it was evident that its owner was
either dead or married, and her womanly
activity was exercised in other locuses and
focuses. No other manifestation of what
Goethe (impatiently) calls the &#8220;eternal
woman&#8221; was present; and May&#8217;s expression
almost approached to a smile as he opened
the door of the spacious bath-room, and
noted the naked mantels and marble slabs,
unencumbered by china dogs, translated
vases, and other traps for the unwary. On
the shelf was a noble pile of rough and
manly towels, and as he turned the faucet,
he found that the water was copious and
cold. From all this you may infer that Mr.
Austin May was a bachelor. I have committed
myself to no such statement as yet,
and May himself would have been the first
to term your curiosity&mdash;at the present stage
of your acquaintance with him&mdash;an impertinence.
As he turned away from the bath-room
the smile of satisfaction died away<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[9]</span>
upon his lips. Mrs. Eastman was still
standing at the door, the incarnation of the
custodian, in iron-gray rigidity of dress, and
equilateral triangularity of white <i>fichu</i>.</p>

<p>&#8220;Everything seems to be all right, Mrs.
Eastman,&#8221; said he, graciously. (Behold how
simple are the needs of man&mdash;give them
but fresh water, space, and peace, and their
desires are filled; while womankind&mdash;are
otherwise.)</p>

<p>&#8220;Everything <i>is</i> all right,&#8221; broke in Mrs.
Eastman, like the offended Vestal deity, at
a statement implying contrary possibilities.
Then again she congealed.</p>

<p>May looked at her more closely, with a
slight shade of annoyance. How was he to
get rid of this woman?</p>

<p>&#8220;You must have had a sadly lonely life
here, Mrs. Eastman,&#8221; said he, by way of
placation. And lo! the flood-gates were
loosened and the tide poured forth. Who
ever could have suspected Mrs. Eastman
of gregarious instinct? As well have fancied
her loquacious. As Moses&#8217;s wand upon
the rock of Horeb, so an adroit phrase
addressed to womankind.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have not complained, Mr. May; and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[10]</span>
nobody can say that I haven&#8217;t done by you
as if it were my own house that I was living
in, and the water-back out of order all the
time, and the pipes freezing all the winter;
and Mr. Eastman, says he, we must have a
furnace fire, and I say no, it ain&#8217;t of enough
account for us two old people, and so we
sit by the kitchen stove, and my sister, Mrs.
Tarbox, with her four children and the scarlet
fever, over at Roxbury, and nobody to
provide for &#8217;em, for John Tarbox&mdash;says I to
Cynthia when he come up to Augusta from
the Provinces (I come from Augusta, Maine,
Mr. May), he ain&#8217;t but a shiftless fellow, you
mark my words, says I; and says she, you
let me alone, Miranda, and I&#8217;ll do as much
by you, s&#8217; she; an&#8217; so it turned out, an&#8217;
many&#8217;s the time I&#8217;ve said to Mr. Eastman,
Mr. Eastman, I must go an&#8217; see Cynthia, s&#8217;s
I, for there she is on her back, with her
hands full of children, an&#8217; no one to do for
&#8217;em but just John Tarbox; an&#8217; s&#8217;s he, Miranda,
it would be tempting Providence for
you to go with your rheumatism, an&#8217; s&#8217;s I,
I can&#8217;t help that, Mr. Eastman (he&#8217;s a member
o&#8217; the church, Mr. Eastman), I guess
Providence ain&#8217;t got no more to say about<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[11]</span>
it than my horse-chestnuts in my dress
pocket, an&#8217; I always wear flannel next my
skin; an&#8217; s&#8217;s I, I&#8217;d go, come what may, but
for Mr. May&#8217;s silver, s&#8217;s I (I keep it under
my bed, Mr. May, and have slept upon it
every mortal night since I took this house),
an&#8217; I know I saw a moth in the best parlor
last week, an&#8217; the furniture not beaten since
April; an&#8217; so six weeks gone since I saw
my sister; an&#8217; since there&#8217;s a foreigner in
the kitchen, s&#8217; I to Mr. Eastman, Mr. Eastman&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;My dear Mrs. Eastman,&#8221; interposed
May, gently, &#8220;I had no idea you thought it
necessary to stick so close to the house.
Now I beg that you will go at once. My
servant will get all I want for dinner. You
and Mr. Eastman must both go, and don&#8217;t
think of coming back before to-morrow&mdash;haven&#8217;t
you any other visits to pay?&#8221;</p>

<p>Mrs. Eastman, who had started at the
&#8220;my dear Mrs. Eastman&#8221; as if May had
offered to kiss her, admitted, ungraciously,
that her husband&#8217;s sister lived in Jamaica
Plain. But the foreign valet was, evidently,
still in her mind; and, after sundry prognostications
as to the domestic evils to result<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[12]</span>
from &#8220;that man&#8217;s&#8221; presence in the
kitchen, she finally removed herself, with
some precipitation, only when May, in desperation,
began to take off his coat. Left
to himself, May resumed his coat, drew a
chair to the window, sighed, and lit a cigarette.
Mrs. Eastman&#8217;s disappearance was
followed by a distant shriek; and shortly
afterward there was a slight scratching at
the door. May opened it, and the St. Bernard
dog walked gravely in and stretched
himself by the chair; a certain humorous
expression about his square jowl indicating
that he had been the cause of the shriek in
question. It was a bad quarter of an hour
for Mrs. Eastman&#8217;s nerves. Fides was the
dog&#8217;s name, and his master patted his head
approvingly.</p>

<p>May sat down again, and his eye roamed
over the stretch of green turf, a view
broken above by the huge arms of button-wood,
and canopies of English elm.
Shortly afterward he saw the valet emerge
from a side entrance, and step hastily across
the lawn into the shade of a great hemlock,
where he stood, gesticulating wildly.
A minute or two later Mrs. Eastman, in an<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[13]</span>
Indian shawl and purple bonnet, appeared
in progress down the carriage-road, limply
accompanied by her lord and master.
When she disappeared, with her husband
and a red and roomy carpet-bag, behind
the avenue of elms, the sinuous oriental
emerged from the hemlock, and shook his
fist. Silence supervened. The prospect of
peace emboldened May to light a large
cigar. The valet returned to the house,
and no sound was audible but the chirping
of the birds, the rustle of leaves, and the
dignified and heavy breathing of the hound
of St. Bernard.</p>

THE PAVILION BY THE LILIES.</h3>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">As</span> May was knocking off the last white
ash from his caba&ntilde;a, his servant knocked
softly, entered, and bowed. Rising, May,
followed by the St. Bernard, descended and
entered the dining-room. Upon the walls
were six pictures, four of which were portraits
of persons, and two of indigestible
fruit. The persons seemed to have been
eating the fruit. The portraits were all
Copleys, and comprised, first, a gentleman
in a red coat and a bag-wig; second, a young
lady with a sallow complexion and a lilac
satin dress cut so low that only a profusion
of lace concealed her deficiencies of figure;
third, an elderly scholar with long transparent
fingers and sinister expression;
fourth, a nice old lady with a benignant
grin. The eyes of the old lady beamed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[15]</span>
amiably down upon the table, where lay a
snowy cloth and a glorious breakfast, consisting
of a fish, a bird, a peach, and a pint
of claret. The genius who had wrought
this miracle disappeared, and May was left
undisturbed.</p>

<p>The fish had gone the way of all flesh,
and the bird had gone the way of the fish,
and the first glass of L&eacute;oville was awaiting
translation to the sky of human reveries,
when there was a sound of carriage-wheels
upon the gravel. May started. The glass
of claret crashed untasted to the floor, and
its owner sprang upon his feet and fled precipitately.
Just as the door-bell rang, he
escaped from the garden door of the hall
and plunged into a maze of shrubbery;
with a hurried sign to the silent servant as
he passed. Rapidly and circuitously, he
circled back behind the hedges until a successful
flank movement brought him to the
main driveway at the point where he remembered
Mrs. Eastman had disappeared;
here, by a bold dash he secured the front
lawn; and a few cautious steps brought
him to the side-door of the large, low stone
pavilion aforementioned. Drawing a brass<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[16]</span>
key from his pocket, he managed to turn
a grating lock and entered. The door
closed behind him and was carefully bolted
on the inside. The interior was quite dark;
but May cautiously felt his way to one of
the front windows, and opening the sash,
turned the slats of the blind to a horizontal
position. Through this he peered, breathless
with his run. At the front door of the
house was the same carryall that had
brought him from the station; but its occupants
were not visible. May saw the St.
Bernard dog silently threading his way
through the bushes, his nose upon the
trail; a minute later, and he scratched upon
the door of the pavilion.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hush,&#8221; hissed May, angrily.</p>

<p>The dog scratched, softly. With an impatient
imprecation, May opened it; the
dog had a bit of paper in his mouth. May
snatched it eagerly.</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>Madame d&#8217;Arrebocques</i>&#8221; was written upon
it, in the hand of Schmidt, his valet. &#8220;<i>Elle
doit attendre.</i>&#8221;</p>

<p>Madame d&#8217;Arrebocques? May knew no
such person. Madame d&#8217;Arrebocques?
Why should she write? Why had she not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[17]</span>
sent her card? Had Schmidt spelled the
name right? Ah! at last he had it, thanks
to Mrs. Eastman&#8217;s garrulity. This could
be no other than Cynthia Tarbox, the ill-married
sister of Miranda, his ch&acirc;telaine.
And ill-mannered fortune! they had missed
each other on the way. Mrs. Eastman might
return at any moment. As he pondered,
the carryall moved slowly off; but as it
passed the window, he noted that it contained
no other figure than the station-master.
The woman, then, was left behind.</p>

<p>May tore out a card and wrote upon it, in
German, <i>Sie muss fort!</i> and handed it to
Fides, the dog, who trotted silently off.
What means Schmidt used, May never
knew; but some ten minutes later, four
children came screaming down the avenue,
running and gasping for breath, followed
by a thin and wiry woman, robed
in a flapping whitey-brown duster, whose
haste and streaming bonnet-ribbons bore
every evidence of extreme mental perturbation.</p>

<p>Shortly afterward Schmidt himself appeared,
in his hands a glass and another<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[18]</span>
bottle of the same claret. By a refinement
of delicacy, the glass was full. &#8220;<i>Monsieur
n&#8217;a pas fini son deje&uacute;ner</i>,&#8221; said he; and May
took the glass with trembling fingers, but
put it down untasted.</p>

<p>&#8220;Schmidt,&#8221; said he, in French, &#8220;it is
nearly midday. You must bring everything
here. I dare not go back to the
house.&#8221;</p>

<p>The valet evinced no surprise, but
nodded and disappeared. Left to himself,
May opened the shutters of several of the
windows and looked out. The side of the
pavilion that was farthest from the house
rose directly out of the broad pond or ornamental
lake already referred to. This
was to the west; the northern was screened
by a dense growth of pines, the southern
contained the entrance door before mentioned,
and the eastern fa&ccedil;ade commanded
the house, which was some two hundred
yards distant across the avenue. May
looked out across the water, which was an
ornamental piece fringed with reeds and
water-flowers. In the centre of the little
lake rose a low round island, which had
a comfortable rustic seat and a soft and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[19]</span>
grassy surface. May pressed a small knob
in the wall near the window, and coming
back from it, took a heavy book from one
of the dwarf bookcases that lined the large
room. The book was a quarto edition of
Burton&#8217;s &#8220;Anatomy of Melancholy;&#8221; and
immediately afterward the adjoining section
of bookcase swung slowly forward
from the wall, revealing a descending passageway.
Through this May disappeared,
and the bookcase swung itself back into
place.</p>

<p>Some minutes later, Schmidt entered, after
several knocks, with a large japanned
tray. Upon this tray was a small paper of
bromide of potassium, two boxes of cigars,
strong and mild, a carafe of cognac, seltzer,
a large opera-glass, a powerful dark-lantern,
and a six-barrelled silver-mounted revolver.
Fides lay on a mat on the floor; but his
master was nowhere visible in the room.
Schmidt set the tray upon the table and
looked about him. Being alone, it must be
confessed that his cosmopolitan face showed
traces of surprise.</p>

<p>The whole interior of the pavilion obviously
contained but one room; and in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[20]</span>
that room Austin May was nowhere to be
seen. In the centre was a huge long centre-table
of carven oak; it was covered with
dust, and upon it was but one large book&mdash;Burton&#8217;s
&#8220;Anatomy of Melancholy.&#8221; All
the four walls were lined with filled bookcases,
and, above them were serried ranks
of engravings, etchings, drawings, but nothing
that was not in black and white. Most
of these had woman for a subject, but woman
always either in her least agreeable or
most unspiritual aspect&mdash;Katherines with
Petruchio, Madame de Staels, Harriet Martineaus,
Manon Lescauts, Cressidas, and
Marneffes; Messalinas, Hecubas, Dana&euml;s,
Judiths, daughters of Herodias; an engraving
of the Appalachian Women&#8217;s Rights
Association, and a charcoal sketch of Daudet&#8217;s
<i>Sappho</i>. And of such as were not real
persons or historical characters, there was
but one common characteristic, namely, that
all were shamelessly naked of body and unspiritual
of face. The sole exception to this
rule stood at the farther end of the room
from Schmidt; it was a full-sized and marvellously
perfect reproduction of the Venus
of Milo; having the cynical inscription<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[21]</span>
upon its pedestal, &#8220;A woman without
rights.&#8221;</p>

<p>Schmidt gave a long low whistle, as he
went about the room to examine these engravings;
then he returned to the centre-table,
wholly at a loss. May surely had
not left the pavilion; but where was he?
He looked out of the windows, and saw only
the pine-grove, the house, the lawn, and the
lake. In the centre of the lake was a large
fountain, plashing merrily, and shaped like
the coronal of some huge lily. As he
was watching this, the fountain suddenly
stopped; the water-petals wavered and fell,
revealing a small grass island that had been
screened by the circlet of playing water.
A moment after, he started at his master&#8217;s
voice; May was immediately behind him,
calmly putting a book back in the bookcase.
It was the Burton&#8217;s &#8220;Anatomy.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You may go now, Schmidt; I shall not
want you until to-morrow. You will stay
in the under part of the house; and not go
out under any circumstances, unless you
hear a pistol-shot. When you hear my pistol
fired you will come out rapidly. If fired
twice, you will run to the stable for a horse.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[22]</span>
If I want you to do anything, I will send
Fides with a note.&#8221;</p>

<p>Schmidt bowed his comprehension and
was about to withdraw.</p>

<p>&#8220;Stop,&#8221; said May, &#8220;there is one thing
more. You must go to Brookline village
and hire a fast horse and a buggy, without
a driver; put the horse in the stable, but
don&#8217;t unharness him, and shut the door.
You may go.&#8221; Schmidt went.</p>

<p>Left once more to himself, May examined
the stores that had been left by his familiar
upon the oaken table. The inspection
seemed to be satisfactory. He then consulted
his watch, and found with a start of
surprise that it was already afternoon. The
watch was an elaborate repeater, giving the
hour, minute, and second, the signs of the
zodiac, the year of our Lord, and the day of
the month. This latter was August 14th,
as has been said; the time, after twelve.</p>

<p>May&#8217;s behavior upon this discovery was
precipitate and peculiar. First, he arranged
with great care the calcium light apparatus
so that it commanded the front stoop of the
house; then he carefully closed all the
shutters of the pavilion save the one toward<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[23]</span>
the house. By this window he sat, peering
through the slats of the blind. The sun,
getting into the west, shone full upon the
stone front porch; and May kept still there,
watching it, in the silence of the midsummer
afternoon.</p>

PAUL AND VIRGINIA.</h3>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Thus</span> fortified in a material way against
the approach of any enemy, and exalted in
spirit above the slings and arrows of outrageous
fortune, the minutes seemed hours
and space and time but mediums of his own
control. When his first pipe was finished
he threw it aside and walked openly out
upon the lawn. The very birds were sleepy,
and the park lay spellbound in the shimmer
of its own warm light. Austin took his
way along the margin of the pool; it was
studded with white still lilies that lay dreamily
upon the green water; great gaudy
dragon-flies hung motionless upon the lily-petals,
like silk-robed ladies in some spotless
marble hall.</p>

<p>What was it that gave such interest to
the little familiar pool to him, who had
smoked his cigar by the lotos-pools of Yeddo&#8217;s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[25]</span>
moats, or dreamed these same summer
hours away by the fountain of the Court of
Lions in far Granada? Well enough knew
Mr. Austin May what memory it was that
hung about the place; and he smiled his
mature and mocking smile as he remembered
his boyish love. Many times had
they two wandered there, May Austin and
himself, wandering together through crusty
Uncle Austin&#8217;s strange demesne; his uncle
Austin, her aunt&#8217;s husband. Old John Austin
had married for love a poor and beautiful
cousin whose mother had engineered
the marriage against the girl&#8217;s will; and
they had hated one another very cordially.
Too proud to be divorced, John Austin had
built himself this strange pavilion where
his wife had promised she would never go.
She kept her word faithfully; and he never
went into the house without first sending
in his card. They met in company, and
with the greatest courtesy, and gave their
grand due dinners of sixteen, each at one
end of the long table, with a splendid high
&eacute;pergne between. Mrs. Austin had taken
May Austin into her lonely bosom, and Uncle
John had had Austin May home from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[26]</span>
college, where his bounty kept him, and had
given him his taste for claret, and tried to
give his knowledge of the world. And they
used to sit there, he and his uncle, in this
same pavilion, smoking, close hedged in
from womankind. And when the old man
had fallen asleep, Austin would creep out
into the park, and walk there with his
lovely cousin May. And on one summer
day, for all the world like this, he won her
heart, this gay young Harvard senior, all
among the rushes by the lily-pool. And
Austin had gone back into the pavilion,
quaking, to tell his uncle, and found the
latter very dignified and dead, a bottle of
the famous Eclipse Lafite close by his elbow.
As with the old French poet</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="first">&#8220;Hear ye, who are soon to die,</div>
<div class="indent">What Villon did before he started&mdash;</div>
<div class="verse">He drank one glass of Burgundy;</div>
<div class="indent">This he did; and then, departed.&#8221;</div>
</div></div>

<p>the claret had not been wasted; its very
last glass had been savored by its master
before his spirit took flight.</p>

<p>Austin May was overcome with horror.
He ran and gave the alarm at the house,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[27]</span>
and then sought his cousin May, whom he
found, standing lovely, in the twilight by
the lilies. He kissed her, preliminarily,
and put his strong arm about her slender
waist; then he broke the news to her, and
then he kissed her again, by way of peroration.</p>

<p>Now May Austin was shocked; but not
so much so as if she had seen her uncle
since her aunt&#8217;s death, which had happened
some three years before. He had suffered&mdash;even
commanded&mdash;that she should go on
living at the house; but since then, there
being no covenance requiring his attendance
at the family table, he had lived, eaten,
and drunk, entirely in the pavilion. Miss
Austin had had a fancy that she had seen
him groping about in the shrubbery from
time to time, and spying at her through the
leaves; but upon the only occasion when
she had gone to see him&mdash;it was to thank
him for some birthday present, distantly
conveyed&mdash;he had most mysteriously disappeared.
But, as if he appreciated her
visit, and were doing her all the honor
possible, the fountain played its highest&mdash;an
almost unheard-of thing since Mrs.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[28]</span>
Austin&#8217;s death. When she had been alive,
the fountain had always played while she
was walking in the garden. Uncle John,
though prejudiced, was always courteous.</p>

<p>But the next memory was clearer yet to
Austin May; and even now a twinge of sadness,
as he recalled it, spoiled one puff or
so of his fragrant caba&ntilde;a. For it was by
this same lily-pool, a few days later. Uncle
Austin&#8217;s remains had been duly disposed of,
according to the terms of the will, and he and
pretty May had met for the last time; the
last time for a few years, he had said; the
last time forever, as she had feared. Austin,
indeed, had rebelled at this, and spoken
boldly of renouncing everything; but she
had persevered, and made him see that it
was best, at least for a trial term of years,
for him to comply with his uncle&#8217;s last behest.
And so he was going abroad; and
she walked with him, by the lily-pool,
through the lawn, through the hedge to the
little seat beneath the linden that had been
her favorite; and there they had said good-by,
with kisses and tears; and the same
grim station-master, messenger of fate! had
carried him off in his carryall, appropriately<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[29]</span>
named. &#8220;The kisses had been very sweet,
but the tears had been superfluous.&#8221;</p>

<p>May smiled as he thought of this, and,
lighting another cigar, went back of the pavilion.
There he threw back a drawer in
the carven oak-table and drew out the queer
old will. It was nothing but a copy, bearing
the lugubrious skull and cinerary urn
which form the seal of the Norfolk County
probate court; but it was already yellow
with time, and as May turned amusedly over
the old leaves the dust dropped from them
upon his spotless Poole-built trousers. Ah,
a good judge of claret was old Uncle Austin;
a good judge of claret and of other
things. May looked at the bottle of the
famous Eclipse (he had not yet tasted it,
and there is a certain worldly wisdom
about claret very inspiring to those who
meditate a practical course of action), and
began to read. But his hand shook, as he
opened the will, and any doctor seeing him
would have treated our hero for nervous
prostration, or sent him to a faith-healer at
the very least.</p>

<p>&#8220;In the name of God, Amen. I, John
Austin, gentleman, being of sound mind<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[30]</span>
and disposing memory, and a widower, for
which I am reverently thankful&#8221; (it has
been mentioned that Mrs. Austin died some
years before) &#8220;do make and declare this
my last will and testament.</p>

<p>&#8220;My body I consign to ashes, and direct
that it be duly cremated under supervision
of my executors; my soul I recommend to
him who made it, provided that He have not
already taken the soul of Georgiana Austin
Austin, my late wife, under his same supervision,
in which case I reverently pray that
it be left to my own disposition.</p>

<p>&#8220;I bequeath to my executors the sum of
Five Thousand Dollars, and direct that it
be expended in the erection of a large white
marble monument to my late wife, aforesaid,
said monument to be designed after the
florid manner of the later Gothic, and to be
placed upon my family lot at Mount Auburn,
and to bear, besides the name of my late
wife aforesaid, but one inscription, viz.:
<span class="smcap">A Perfect Woman</span>.</p>

<p>&#8220;I direct my executors to pay the sum of
five hundred dollars annually to the niece of
my late wife aforesaid, May Austin, until
she be married; and upon her marriage I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[31]</span>
direct that said sum be annually paid to her
husband, for his sole use and consolation.</p>

<p>&#8220;I devise and bequeath my bin of Lafite
claret, so-called Eclipse, to my nephew, Austin
May, together with all my other estate,
real and personal, stocks, bonds, moneys,
goods, and chattels, wherever the same be
found, but subject only to the following
condition, namely: I direct my executors
to manage and invest all such moneys and
estate, save the use of my house in Brookline,
Massachusetts, which I give to my said
nephew directly; and all the income, rents,
and profits of such estate to pay over to my
said nephew annually upon his sole receipt;
<i>provided</i>, that if he marry at any time within
eleven years after my death, or before he
shall reach the age of thirty-five, whichever
shall first occur, then and in that case I revoke
all the devises and bequests to my said
nephew aforesaid; but direct my executors
to deliver such of my Eclipse claret as then
remains, to the most prominent Total Abstinence
Association which shall then exist
in the town of Boston; and all the rest and
residue of my estate I devise and bequeath
absolutely and in fee to my residuary legatee.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[32]</span>
And I have written the name of
said&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>At this point in his reading, May heard a
woman&#8217;s laugh. It seemed to come from
the shrubbery close by. In order to get
more light for the will, he had opened the
middle slats of the blind toward the trees;
so that it almost seemed possible for a tall
girl, standing close to the pavilion, to look
directly in. With inconceivable agility,
May dropped to the floor, beneath the window-sill,
and ran rapidly around the large
room on his hands and knees, close to the
wall. When beneath the table where he
had left his opera-glass, he took it up, and
adjusting it hastily, stood upon his knees,
high enough to look through the open shutter
in the window toward the house. Sure
enough, he had hardly got the proper focus,
when a young girl emerged from the
shrubbery and walked down the road. But
she was very young, only eighteen or so,
and though admirably pretty, May was confident
that he had never seen her before.
He watched her until she had disappeared
in the distance; and then, rising to his feet,
returned to the reading of the will. But<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[33]</span>
first he altered the angle of the slats of the
blind, so that it would be impossible for
anyone standing outside to look into the
room.</p>

<p>&#8220;And I have written the name of the said
residuary legatee in a sealed envelope,
which I hereby incorporate as part of this
will and append thereto; and I direct that
said envelope be not opened, but remain in
the custody of my executors, or of the
proper court, until my said nephew marry,
or reach the age of thirty-five, or until eleven
years have elapsed from the date of my
death, whichever shall first happen; and
thereupon my said executors may open
the same and deliver a copy thereof to my
said nephew; and proceed to pay over and
deliver all my estate, real and personal, to
my residuary legatee therein mentioned.</p>

<p>&#8220;And I will explain, for the benefit of
the gaping and the curious, that this I do
that my nephew may profit by my experience
of early marriages. For no man should
by law be allowed to choose what woman
shall be his wife until he be arrived at the
age when he may be hoped to have sufficient
discretion not to choose any woman at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[34]</span>
all.&#8221; Then followed the appointment of
executors; and that was all.</p>

<p>May laid aside the scandalous old will
and began to think.</p>

<p>How he had laughed at the last clause,
he and May Austin, as they wandered by
the lily-pond that evening! And when she
had persuaded him not at once to give it
all up and marry penniless, he had tried to
make the best of it. If she would not
marry him then, what were eleven years?
Eleven years&mdash;bah! August 14, 1886&mdash;why,
he would only be thirty-three and she twenty-seven!
But she had refused to make it
an engagement, refused even to write to
him; and the poor young Bachelor of Arts
had gone off to his steamer most unhappily.
And that farewell kiss under the lindens!
And the letters he had written back&mdash;from

AN IROQUOIS IN TROUVILLE.</h3>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">From</span> Liverpool Austin May went to
London; from London to Paris; from
Paris by the special mail to Constantinople;
thence to Athens and Alexandria;
and thence to Bombay and Calcutta and
Hong Kong; and the impetus of his flight
had almost carried him over the Pacific and
back to America again, but that he held
back on the shore of Japan. He travelled
in that country, then in Thibet or in Turkestan.
Three years were spent by him in
the acquisition of strange drugs, curious
pipes, and embroideries, wild songs, and
odd languages. He lived in Damascus,
Samarcand, Morocco, possibly in Timbuctoo.
History records not nor does May
Austin, how often he wrote to her. But
the summer of 1879 saw him alight at the
Gare de Lyon, in Paris. The heat and solitude<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[38]</span>
of that city were equally oppressive,
and he fled to the nearest coast. That evening
he was seated, robed in soft cloth and
starched linen, on the wide veranda of the
great <i>H&ocirc;tel des Rochers Noirs</i>, at Trouville.</p>

<p>No one who pines for outdoor life, primitive
conditions, and barbarism&mdash;and May
was one of the wildest of these&mdash;but must
admit that the trammels, conventions, and
commodities which so annoy him are, after
all, the result of infinite experiments of the
human race, conducted through all time;
and as such, presumably, each one was
deemed successful when made, and adopted
accordingly. No question but that men had
flannel shirts before starched linen, women
flowing robes and sandals before corsets
and high-heeled shoes; and the prehistoric
&#8220;masher&#8221; knocked down his lady-love
with a club before he learned to court her
with a monocle and a bunch of unseasonable
roses. But all these changes were, at
the time, deemed improvements; and one
who has lived three years in Thibet or
Crim-Tartary, and arrives suddenly at
Trouville, is in a fair position to judge impartially.
And it is not to be denied that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[39]</span>
May was conscious of a certain Capuan
comfort, of an unmanly, hot-house luxury,
as he sat before the little table with his
carafe of ice, brandy, and seltzer, felt the
cool stiffness of his linen shirt, smoked his
pressed <i>regalia</i>, and watched the ladies with
their crisp and colored dresses and their
neat and silken ankles as they mounted in
their landaus for their evening drive. A
full string-orchestra was stationed among
the electric lights near by, which dispensed,
with much verve, the light-hearted rhythms
of the latest opera bouffe; and beyond the
planes and lindens shone the moonlit sea, as
if it also were highly civilized, and part of
the decoration of the place. May knocked
the ashes from his cigar as who should say,
&#8220;I, too, am a Parisian of the nineteenth
century;&#8221; quaffed a few sparkles from the
iced carafe and bottle, and pretended to be
interested in the latest Faits-Paris of <i>Figaro</i>.
He was beginning to realize the delights of
youth and riches and free travel; he had
been nothing but a school-boy in America,
and a sort of wild man since.</p>

<p>And as he so sat, there came to a table
next him two people, and sat down. One<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[40]</span>
was a middle-aged man, with an iron-gray
imperial, a tight white waistcoat, and the
rosette of the legion of honor at his button-hole.
The other was the most beautiful
woman he had ever seen. She was dressed
in the most delicate and languorous cloud
of violet and gray, strengthened here and
there by black lace; no ribbon, jewel, or
flower was on her lustrous black hair, or
about the soft and creamy neck; and she
was evidently much absorbed in what her
companion was saying, for May could see
that she clinched her fan in her hand that
was beneath the table until the delicate
ivory broke. They talked very rapidly, in
French; but May, whose acquaintance with
unknown oriental dialects was so manifold
and various, knew hardly French enough
&#8220;to last him over night.&#8221; And it is of especial
importance that one&#8217;s French should
last over night.</p>

<p>Whatever they were saying, they were
reiterating it with continually increasing
force. The man in the tight frock-coat began
hissing it between his pointed teeth,
and the pretty woman crushed the last
fragment of the fan to ivory slivers on the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[41]</span>
floor. At last, the gentleman rose, and
with a <i>pardieu</i> which even May&#8217;s untrained
ear could recognize, upset a champagne
glass, and strode hastily away; the lady
eyed him until he disappeared, and then
drooped her long lashes, and hid her eyes in
her pretty hand. Her bosom rose and fell
convulsively, and May&#8217;s chivalric heart beat
sympathetically in the same time. Suddenly
her deep eyes opened, and opened full on
Austin May&#8217;s.</p>

<p>&#8220;Sir,&#8221; said she, in English, &#8220;you are a
gentleman&mdash;save me!&#8221; Save her? Aye,
Austin May would have saved her from the
devil or the deep sea, and with no thought
of salvage. All he said was, &#8220;Why, certainly.&#8221;
It afterward occurred to him that
he should have said, &#8220;Pray, command me,
madam.&#8221; But this seemed to satisfy her,
for she unbosomed herself directly.</p>

<p>&#8220;I know I may trust an American,&#8221; said
she. &#8220;Listen&mdash;I will confide to you my
true name. That man&mdash;that <i>mouchard</i>&mdash;with
whom you saw me, sinks I am ze
Comtesse Polacca de Valska. Well, I am
ze Comtesse Polacca de Valska. Now you
know all.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[42]</span>Unfortunately, Austin May knew very
little. But evidently the Comtesse Polacca
de Valska was a personage of European
reputation. He bowed.</p>

<p>&#8220;What can I do?&#8221; said he, earnestly.
&#8220;Madam de Valska has but to command.&#8221;
(This was better.)</p>

<p>&#8220;Hist!&#8221; said she, mysteriously. &#8220;Polacca
de Valska&mdash;never mention ze name.
Eet ees a spell, in Poland; even now my
noble Polacco languishes in Siberia; but in
France, in Russia&mdash;eet ees a doom. Say
zat I&mdash;say zat I am your compatriot&mdash;Mrs.
Walkers&mdash;anysing.&#8221; And the nerve which
the unhappy countess had shown throughout
the interview suddenly collapsed. She
burst into tears. As she dissolved, the
American congealed, all the blue blood of
Boston rigid in his veins. When the little
Frenchman appeared, May offered his arm
to the countess; and together they swept
proudly to the door of the hotel.</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>Arr&ecirc;tez</i>,&#8221; cried the Frenchman. &#8220;<i>Connaissez-vous</i>&mdash;do
you know, sare, who it is?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is my friend&mdash;my friend, Mrs. Peter
Faneuil, of Boston,&#8221; said May, with a readiness
that charmed him at the time.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[43]</span>&#8220;<i>Mais, monsieur</i>&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you dare, sir, to&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>May glared at him for a moment, and the
latter recoiled, like any Frenchman, before
his Anglo-Saxon attitude. They entered
the hall of the hotel; the countess pressed
his arm convulsively in her gratitude, her
heart too full for words. &#8220;<i>Merci, chevalier</i>,&#8221;
said she, simply. May&#8217;s heart bounded at
the compliment, and with satisfaction that
he understood her French. &#8220;I have a
carriage here,&#8221; said she; and they found
the elegant landau still at the door.</p>

<p>&#8220;Where shall we go?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I will tell you later,&#8221; said she.</p>

<p>May got in, and a footman closed the
door of the carriage. The liveried coachman
whipped up the horses, and the pair
rolled forth into the darkness of the summer
night.</p>

<p>At this point in his recollections, May
looked at his glass of claret and re-lit his
cigar; and though he did not know it,
this was precisely the course of action that
had been adopted at the time by the Frenchman
with the rosette. He drew his chair
up to the table where the countess had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[44]</span>
been sitting, with a slight shrug of his padded
shoulders, and more imperturbability
of manner than would have flattered the valiant
defender of oppressed beauty, had he
been there to see it.</p>

<p>But at this period May was whirling
along in the countess&#8217;s carriage, through
the darkness of the night, close by the
sea-beach and the pale shining of the long,
slow surf.</p>

THESEUS AND ARIADNE.</h3>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> next morning May rose after a sleepless
night, and wandered pensively along
the beach. His head was full of the Comtesse
Polacca de Valska; perhaps a drop
or two of that charming personage had
brimmed over from his head into his heart.
Their romantic drive had ended in no more
romantic a locality than the railroad station;
there he had parted from her, perhaps forever.
For she had assured him that after
her meeting with the rosetted Frenchman
the air of Trouville would not be good for
her, and she had taken the night mail for
Paris. Her maid was to follow on the next
day with luggage. As soon as she was
safely established, and had, at least temporarily,
thrown the enemies of her unhappy
country off her track, she was to let May
(her deliverer, as she entitled him) know,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[46]</span>
and he could see her again. But, alas! as
she tearfully remarked, that might never
be. The French republic was now seeking
to curry favor with the despotism of the
Czar, and even Prince Obstropski had had
to leave Paris for Geneva. Austin wanted
to kiss her hand as she departed, but feared
lest this trivial homage should jar upon a
heroine like her. The bell rang, the guard
cried out; one last glance of her dark eyes,
and all was over. She was gone, and May
felt that perhaps the most romantic episode
of his life was ended.</p>

<p>He went back to the hotel, but, unfortunately,
none of the famous Eclipse claret
was at hand. So he contented himself with
brandy and soda. Visions of nihilistic fair
ones, of Polish patriots and <i>Italia irredenta</i>
kept him wakeful through the night. For
the Comtesse had told him of her Italian
descent, of her alliance with the great patriot
Milanese house, the Castiglioni dei
Cascadegli.... And the Count Polacco
de Valski was immured for life in the
Siberian mines.... Poor devil! May
cut another cigar, and reflected upon the
Count&#8217;s unhappy condition.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[47]</span>In a few days he received a letter from
the countess. It was a mere line, incidentally
telling him that she had not established
herself at Paris, but at Baden-Baden; but
it was principally filled with pretty thanks
for his &#8220;heroic chivalry.&#8221; The expression
had seemed a trifle too strong at the time,
even to Austin May.</p>

<p>But when he arrived at Baden-Baden,
and saw how charming the countess was in
her now elaborate <i>entourage</i>, he made allowances.
Man is generous by nature, especially
to beautiful heroines with husbands in
Siberian mines. May thought of the hapless
Polacco de Valski as turning out polyform
lead-pencils by the ribboned bunch,
and marking them BBBB, and then, alternately,
HHHH. May had been much exercised
in mind how to explain his sudden
trip to Baden-Baden, and had devised many
plausible reasons for going, all of which
proved superfluous. The countess did not
seem in the least surprised. He found her
weeping over a letter. &#8220;See,&#8221; said she, &#8220;it
is from Serge.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The d&mdash;&mdash; Really?&#8221; said May.</p>

<p>The countess folded the letter, kissed it,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[48]</span>
and replaced it in her bosom. This was an
extremely embarrassing proceeding to May,
and he kept some time silent. With his
Anglo-Saxon awkwardness at social comedy,
he thought that Polacco might as well
be kept out of the case.</p>

<p>&#8220;Shall we go for a drive?&#8221; said she, at
last.</p>

<p>&#8220;Delighted,&#8221; said Austin May.</p>

<p>The drives about Baden-Baden are
charming. You wind for miles upon the
brows of castle-crowned hills, overhanging
the gay little valley; and then you plunge
into the ancient gloom of the Black Forest,
and the eerie pines, and a delicious shiver
of wildness and solitude, all the time with
the feeling that the Kursaal and its band
are close at hand, should the silence grow
oppressive. There, if your heart do trouble
you, you can look at pretty women; and, if
the eternal verities beset your spirit, gamble
for napoleons.</p>

<p>The countess drove two little cream-colored
ponies, and encouraged May to smoke
his cigarette most charmingly....
Bah! why go on with it? Even now, over
the Eclipse claret, May could not but admit<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[49]</span>
that he had spent in Baden-Baden three of
the most charming weeks of his life. He
would not mind passing three such weeks
again, could he be sure they would be <i>just</i>
three such weeks, and that they would end
at the same time. But, <i>que diable!</i> because
the play is amusing, we do not wish to stay
in the theatre forever. And May nervously
glanced at the window, as he thought he
heard the sound of carriage-wheels again.
He had smoked too much strong tobacco,
probably; but, after all, it was even now
only the middle of the afternoon&mdash;not sunset,
or near it. He might have to come to
stronger drugs than tobacco, to stronger
deeds than tobacco-smoke, ere the evening
was over. Hence that arsenal with which
he had provided himself.</p>

<p>Well, to cut it short, he fell in love with
her. Of course he did. He adored her.
Possible! He wanted to marry her. This
seemed impossible; but he had most certainly
said so. He was barely twenty-five,
and she&mdash;well, she was older than he was.
And she had a husband in the Siberian
mines. As May looked back upon it, this
seemed her only advantage. But, after all,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[50]</span>
it was her patriotism that first attracted him&mdash;her
heroism, her devotion to her unhappy
cause, or causes. Italia irredenta! Poland!
Nihilism! For May was not quite
clear which one or more of these was chief
in her mind; and nihilism was a new word
then, but it sounded dangerous and attractive.
Could he not be her chevalier,
her lieutenant, her esquire? It was no
more than Byron had done for Greece,
after all. He was free, independent (for
the next eight years)&mdash;broken-hearted, he
was going to add, but stopped. After all,
May Austin had not refused to marry him;
and three of the eleven years were gone.
At all events, there was nothing to prevent
his attaching himself to a forlorn hope, if
he chose. Eight years of chances were in
his favor; and at the worst&mdash;if neither May
Austin got married, nor Polacco died&mdash;he
could make a rescue of the husband from
Siberia and do the BB pencils himself. He
lay awake many nights thinking of these
things, and at last he was emboldened to
speak of them to her.</p>

<p>How well he remembered the day he did
so! The day&mdash;but no, it was evening.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[51]</span>
They had driven out after dinner, (did any
man ever propose before breakfast?) and
the scene was a moonlit glade in the Black
Forest. The two ponies stood motionless;
but their fair owner was much moved as
he poured into her delicate ear his desires
and devotions. It was so noble of him, she
said, and was moved to tears. And then
his devotion to her unhappy country! and
she wiped away another tear for Poland or
Italia irredenta. How she wished Serge
could have met him, and could know of
this! And she wiped away another tear
for Serge. But no, my noble American&mdash;noble
citizen of a free country! It could
never be. Poland and she must bear their
woes alone. They could never consent to
drag down a brave young Bostonian in their
wreck. And then, how could she ever reward
him? With her friendship, said Austin.
But the Comtesse seemed to think
her friendship would be inadequate.</p>

<p>The scene was becoming somewhat oppressive;
and May, at least, was conscious
of a certain difficulty in providing for it a
proper termination. In the excitement of
the occasion, he had felt emboldened to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[52]</span>
take one of her hands, which he still retained;
the other was holding the reins of
the two cream-colored ponies. He could
hardly simply drop it&mdash;the hand and the
conversation&mdash;without more; and yet what
suitable catastrophe could there be for the
situation? Might he kiss it, and cut the
conversation? It were a mere act of courtesy,
no breach of respect to the absent
Serge. As a boy of twenty-two he had never
dared; but as a man of twenty-five&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>She did not seem in the least surprised.
Possibly she had thought him older than
twenty-five. But May, after that little ceremony,
had dropped the hand most unmistakably;
and she turned the ponies&#8217; heads
away. May gave a last look to the forest-glade,
as they drove out from it, and reflected
that the place would be impressed
upon his memory forever. It was really astonishing
the number of places that were to
be impressed upon his memory forever!</p>

<p>A restless week followed. He saw the
Countess de Valska every day; but there
was something uncomfortable in their relations&mdash;a
certain savor of an unaccepted
sacrifice, of an offering burned in vain.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[53]</span>The countess would not let him seek the
Austrian foe on her own behalf, nor yet bedew
the soil of Poland with his blood; and
it was very difficult to say what he was to
do for her in Baden-Baden, or, for matter
of that, what the noble Polacco de Valski
could do in Siberia. Poor Serge!</p>

<p>Yes, poor Serge! On the eighth day,
Austin May, calling on the countess, found
her in a lovely <i>n&eacute;glig&eacute;</i>, dissolved in tears.
(He had been refused her door, at first, but
finally, after a little pressing, had been admitted.)
The countess did not look up
when he entered; and Austin stood there,
twisting his hat in sympathy, and looking
at her. Suddenly she lifted her head, and
transfixed his blue eyes with her dewy black
ones.</p>

<p>&#8220;Dead!&#8221; said she.</p>

<p>&#8220;What?&#8221; responded May, anxiously.
&#8220;Poland? Ital&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, no!&#8221; she cried. &#8220;Serge&mdash;Serge!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Your husband?&#8221; cried he&mdash;&#8220;the Count
Polacco&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>The countess dropped her lovely head in
a shower of tears, as when a thick-leaved
tree is shaken by the wind, just after rain.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[54]</span>&#8220;He has been dead a year and a half,&#8221; she
moaned.</p>

<p>&#8220;A year and a half?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nineteen months. He died on the 23d
of February, 1877&mdash;three weeks after the
last letter that I ever got from him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But how&mdash;but how did you never know?&#8221;
said May, wildly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Was it not cruel? The despotism of
the White Czar! Sometimes they would
keep his letters for a year, sometimes they
would let them come directly. They would
not let me know for fear that I&mdash;ah, God!&#8221;
She sprang to her feet with a sweep of her
long robe, and shook her jewelled finger at
the chandelier.</p>

<p>&#8220;Can you blame us that we kill and die
for such a despotism, such a tyranny, as
that?&#8221; Then suddenly, as she crossed by a
sofa, she straightened up to her full height,
like a wave cresting, poised a brief second,
then fell in a heap&mdash;a graceful heap&mdash;her
head resting on the sofa in her hands.</p>

<p>Then the young man had to seek, not to
console her, but to calm her, to lift her from
the floor, to bring her ice-water, a fan, a
feather, pour oil and salt upon the wound,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[55]</span>
toilet-vinegar, or other salads. May never
knew exactly what he did; but it was like
consoling an equinoctial gale. Hardly had
she got fairly calm, and sobbing comfortably,
and sitting in a chair, and he beside
her&mdash;and he remembered patting her
clasped hands, as one does a spoiled child&#8217;s&mdash;when
she would dash upright, upsetting
the chair, and swear her vengeance on the
cruel Czar.... And at this point in his
reminiscences May winced a little; for he
had by no means a distinct recollection that
he had not sworn his vengeance on the Czar
with hers. And, when you come to think
of it, the Czar&#8217;s injuries to Mr. May cried
not as yet for deeds of blood.</p>

DIDO AND &AElig;NEAS.</h3>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">May</span> repeated his visit of condolence every
day for several weeks. At the end of
that time the season at Baden-Baden was
drawing to a close, and it became necessary
that the countess should betake herself and
her sorrowing heart to some other refuge.
May knew this, and it troubled him.</p>

<p>For he now felt that he not only admired
Mme. de Valska as a patriot, but that he
loved her as an exceedingly beautiful and
fascinating woman. Surely, here was the
heroine of his youthful dreams&mdash;a life that
were a poet&#8217;s ideal.</p>

<p>To link himself with her and her noble
aims, to be a Byron without the loneliness,
to combine fame in future history with present
domestic bliss&mdash;what a career!</p>

<p>He loved the countess, he adored her;
and he fancied that she deigned to be not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[57]</span>
indifferent to his devotion, to his sympathy.
But&mdash;there was the shadow of the late
count.</p>

<p>And the countess seemed much broken
by his death. True, she no longer gave
way to wild bursts of passion; she never
wept; in fact, in Austin&#8217;s presence, she rarely
mentioned him. But there was a sadness,
a weak and lonely way about her, as
if she could not live without her Serge&#8217;s
protecting arm. It must have been a moral
support, as he could have done but little
from his Siberian mine; but, whereas she
used to be brave, enterprising, facing the
world alone, now she seemed helpless, confiding,
less heroic, perhaps, but still more
womanly. Austin only loved her the more
for that And it emboldened him a little.
After all, her husband had been dead a year
and a half, though she had only known of
it a few weeks. He determined to speak.
Why should his life&#8217;s happiness&mdash;possibly
hers&mdash;be wrecked upon a mere scruple of
etiquette?</p>

<p>He took his opportunity, one day, when
she spoke of Italy. (Now, that the count was
dead, she seemed to think less of unhappy<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[58]</span>
Poland, and more of unredeemed Italy; as
was natural, she being a Cascadegli.) He
took her hands at the same time, and
begged that she would redeem him with
Italy. His life, his fortune, were at her service,
should she but give him the right to
protect her, and fight her battles for her always.
&#8220;I know,&#8221; he added earnestly, &#8220;how
your heart still bleeds for your noble husband.
But your duty is to your country,
to yourself. And remember, though you
heard of it but yesterday, the Count Polacco
has been dead a year and a half.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nineteen months,&#8221; sighed the countess,
with a sob, going him four weeks better.
And before he left the room they were engaged.
He did not go to bed that night;
but wandered in the moonlight, treading as
on clouds. Favored young man!</p>

<p>In the morning, he noticed with delight
that she had laid aside her long crape veil.
Already, said she, her country called for
her; she must recommence her labors, and
the deep mourning would attract too much
notice. May had vaguely fancied she would
start at once for Milan or Warsaw, and
after a few months&#8217; delay he would meet<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[59]</span>
her, and they would have a quiet marriage
ceremony. But she explained to him that
the true arena of her labors was in Paris.
Here was the focus of conspiracies; here
she must live and have a <i>salon</i>, and call together
her devoted countrymen. Here she
would need his protection, and, with his
American passport, he could safely visit her
oppressed fatherland, when events required
action on the spot.</p>

<p>Obviously, as he recognized with joy,
this plan made it necessary for them to be
married immediately. But then he must
speak to her of his uncle&#8217;s will. Not that
it mattered much; he was quite ready to
renounce fortune, even life, for her; but
she must know that they would not be
rich. It was a mere formality; but it must
be done. So he told her of the curious
will; and how, if he married before August
the fourteenth, 1886, he was to lose all his
uncle&#8217;s property, even to what remained of
the celebrated Eclipse claret. But then,
what was money? Particularly to them,
who had no other aims than love and patriotism;
both commodities not to be bought,
or measured in sterling exchange or napoleons.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[60]</span>
But the countess seemed to attach
much weight to May&#8217;s communication.</p>

<p>Money, alas! was in these sordid times
necessary, even for patriotic revolutions.
The wheels must be greased, even when
Bucephalus drew the chariot. Still, this
was not the essential. She was quite willing
to share her small fortune with the
man whom she loved; but how could she
bear to ruin him&mdash;to make her alliance his
sacrifice? Suppose he should ever repent
his action? And here May began to make
his oaths eternal; but she stopped him.
Was there no other way? Could there
be no escape, no legal device? Lawyers
would do almost anything, if paid enough.
But May shook his head, and pressed again
her hand to his lips; and her dark eyes
brimmed with tears.</p>

<p>She, for herself, would be willing to suffer
him as her adorer, to trust him as her
knight, her follower, as he once had proposed
before. And, by that arrangement,
he would not lose the fortune. But what
would the world say&mdash;the cold and heartless
world? And she looked at May imploringly,
as if for advice.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[61]</span>And May had to admit, in answer, that
the world would be likely to make itself as
disagreeable as usual under similar circumstances&mdash;particularly,
now that the unhappy
count was dead, and could no longer defend
his heroic consort from the spite of petty
spirits. The moral support was something,
after all. May had true Boston reverence
for what the world said; and it never occurred
to him that even a heroine, who had
braved two emperors, might brave its verdict.</p>

<p>For some moments neither spoke. What
was there to say? But the silence grew
oppressive; and at last she broke it with a
cry.</p>

<p>&#8220;Farewell, then,&#8221; said she.</p>

<p>But at this May broke out with a round
oath. Farewell it should never be. What
cared he for his uncle&#8217;s fortune, or for the
estate in Brookline, when his future lay in
Poland? He would have a little left; he
could win more by his own exertions. For
a moment his impetuosity almost overbore
her resistance. But then the Paris <i>salon</i>
was a necessity; and half of her own estate
and all of poor Polacco&#8217;s had been seized<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[62]</span>
by foreign despots. She would think it
over. She would give him an answer that
night. And then there came a lover&#8217;s parting;
and May went back to his hotel, not
wholly desperate, and got the engagement-ring
he had ordered, and sent it to her. It
was of small diamonds; but then there was
a necklace, sent from Paris, of perfect Oriental
pearls. A woman could afford to get
engaged once a month, for such a necklace.</p>

<p>And he had gone back that evening, and
he had found a letter. The countess had
gone, leaving the note behind her. It was
edged with deep black; and May took it
now from his pocket-book, yellow and worn,
with a smile that would have been cynical
had it not been slightly nervous.</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>Tr&egrave;s-cher!</i>&#8221; it began, &#8220;I cannot bear&#8221;
(it was all in French, but we will make
clumsy English of the countess&#8217;s delicate
phrase, as did May, when he read it now)
&#8220;that your love for me should be your ruin.
It is too late for me to deny that you also
have my heart; I can only fly. Otherwise
my woman&#8217;s weakness would destroy either
you or myself. I shall go by the morning
train to Frankfurt, where I shall stop two<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[63]</span>
days. If you do not wish to betray me,
seek not my refuge out. I shall keep the
ring as a pledge&#8221; (she says nothing about
the necklace, it occurred to May, at this late
date)&mdash;&#8220;a pledge that I shall be faithful to
you, as, I hope, you to me. For what are
six or seven years?&#8221; (At her age! thought
May, with a shudder.) &#8220;I will devote them
to my unhappy countrymen.&#8221; (<i>Compatriotes</i>
was the original, which may be feminine.)
&#8220;But wait for me until you are free; and
perhaps, who knows? my Italy redeemed!
I will join you, and be one with you forever.
Meantime you will travel, possibly
forget me! But on the fourteenth of August,
1886, you will be at home. <i>On that
day you will hear from me!</i>&#8221;</p>

<p>May laid the letter down and shuddered.
This was most unquestionably the fourteenth
day of August in the year eighteen hundred
and eighty-six. He seized nervously the
glass of claret; but, as he raised it to his
lips, looked through the blinds, in the direction
of the house. His second glass of
claret fell unheeded to the floor.</p>

<p>A carriage was standing before the front
door, and beside it stood a footman in livery.</p>

THE JUDGMENT OF PARIS.</h3>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> three years following May&#8217;s unhappy
affair with the Countess Polacca de Valska
had been uneventful. He had not plunged
again into foreign parts, but became a student
of the barbarities of civilization. He
saw what is termed the world, particularly
that manifestation of it which attains its
most perfect growth in London and Paris.
Perhaps it would be too much to say that
he forgot the Countess de Valska, but certainly
his feelings toward that unhappy fair
one underwent certain modifications. And
as he was in the meantime in the receipt of
some twenty thousand a year from the estate
of the late John Austin, he by degrees
became more reconciled to the extremely
practical view the cruel countess had taken
of their duties in relation to that gentleman&#8217;s
will.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[68]</span>He very often wondered as to who might
be the residuary legatee. It would be a
wild freak, that he was sure of. It was
quite on the cards for Uncle Austin to have
provided that, since his nephew did not
want the money, it might go to the devil for
all he cared&mdash;or to the Total Abstinence Society.</p>

<p>It is more sad to say that, as time went
by, certain metaphysical doubts as to the
objective reality of the Cascadegli and the
Siberian mine began to obtrude themselves.
Faith of the most stubborn description remained
to him, so far as the countess&#8217;s
Paris salon and her beautiful self was concerned,
but he failed to see the necessary
connection between Trouville, Baden-Baden,
Italia Irredenta, and the Parisian police.
And Serge had removed himself, for an encumbrance,
in a singularly accommodating
way.</p>

<p>But May was a man of his word; and he
looked forward, at first eagerly, and afterward
with mingled emotions, to their promised
next meeting in Brookline, Mass.</p>

<p>The woman Byron might have married
was not the wife for Talleyrand. And May&#8217;s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[69]</span>
volcanic or Byronic age had passed, and he
was in the tertiary period. Taking her for
all she said she was, she wouldn&#8217;t do in society,
and he doubted that she was all she
said she was.</p>

<p>However, it gave him no serious trouble
until after his acquaintance with the beautiful
Mrs. Terwilliger Dehon. Youth has a
long future ahead of it, and a young man
of twenty-seven easily discounts obligations
maturing only in six years. But when May
was thirty, and well launched in London
society&mdash;whether it was the charms of Mrs.
Dehon aforesaid, or the vanishing of youthful
heroism and that increase of comfort
which attends middle life&mdash;a political heroine
like the Countess Polacca de Valska no
longer seemed to him the ideal consort for
a man of his temperament.</p>

<p>Young men have their time for falling in
love with com&eacute;diennes upon the stage; and
then they turn to the com&eacute;diennes of real
life. Only in the latter case it is to be noted
that they ever prefer the heroines of a
tragedy.</p>

<p>It was on the very evening before all advice
became superfluous, that he confided<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[70]</span>
his troubles to Tom Leigh, and asked his
advice. Tom Leigh advised him that &#8220;he
was in a devil of a hole.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But what am I to do?&#8221; said May. &#8220;I
am bound to meet her&mdash;in five years.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Perhaps she won&#8217;t come,&#8221; said Tom.
But Austin shook his head. If she didn&#8217;t
come, there was May Austin&mdash;but he checked
himself. He had never spoken of his cousin
to Tom Leigh. She was doubtless married
ere this; and if she wasn&#8217;t, he preferred her
to the countess.</p>

<p>&#8220;Perhaps her husband ain&#8217;t dead,&#8221; suggested
the resourceful Tom. But May
smiled, bitterly. &#8220;I guess he&#8217;s dead enough&mdash;much
as ever he was.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then I don&#8217;t see but what you&#8217;ll have
to stand the breach of promise suit,&#8221; Tom
concluded, with a grin. In these misfortunes,
truly, there is something pleasant to
our best friends. We know that Messrs.
Winkle and Tupman must have chuckled
in secret over even Bardell vs. Pickwick.
But the idea was unspeakably awful to our
fastidious hero. Moreover, he darkly imagined
that the countess had other resources
than a breach of promise suit.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[71]</span>This was on the evening before the hunt;
on that epochal brink of their first meeting.
And on the next day all this talk became
superfluous; as superfluous as for Falstaff
to demand the time of day.</p>

A LEAD OF HEARTS.</h3>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Terwilliger Dehon</span>&mdash;ah, Mrs. Dehon!
Great heavens! why had they not
met earlier&mdash;before she had sacrificed herself
upon Terwilliger&#8217;s commonplace altars&mdash;before
her radiant youth had been
shrouded in tragedy?</p>

<p>The Russo-French police may be successfully
evaded, but not so the laws of society.
Naught but misery could he see in store
for them both&mdash;one long life-agony of divided
souls.</p>

<p>Of course, it took some time before this
dismal prospect lay fairly out before them.
At their first meeting there was nothing
sadder in sight than the purple hills of Exmoor
and the clear cascade of Bagworthy
Water; and their talk was broken only by
the cheerful yelp of hounds. And there
had been fortune, too, in this; fortune we<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[73]</span>
call fate, when fortune turns out ill. He
had hardly seen her at the Cloudsham
meet, and but just knew who she was.
Thither he had gone with his friends, the
Leighs, to see the red deer hunted in his
ancient lair; and as he stood there, snuffing
with his horse the sea-breeze that came
up from Porlock Bay, immaculate in coat
and patent-leathers, she had ridden up
with a fat and pursy citizen beside her.
This stall-fed citizen was horse-back on
another square-built brute, and it was very
Psychecide to call the wretch her husband.
A Diana, by heaven! thought he; and, indeed,
she sat her horse as any goddess
might, and clothed her own riding-habit as
the moon her covering of cloud.</p>

<p>&#8220;Who&#8217;s that?&#8221; said he to Tom Leigh.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s the girl that married old Dehon,&#8221;
said Tom. &#8220;She did it&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>But when or how she did it Austin never
knew, for just then there was a joyous baying
from the hounds, and whish! they
scampered downward, skirting hanging
Cloudsham Wood. Unluckily, they were
at the wrong end of the field, and before
they reached the steep bit of gorsy moor<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[74]</span>
that overlooks the valley everyone else who
meant to ride had disappeared in the cover
of the forest. She reined in her beautiful
horse on the very brink, and looked up
the valley over Oare Hill; May stood a few
yards below and looked down the valley in
the direction of Porlock. Then she looked
down the valley to Porlock, and May looked
up the valley to Oare Hill. And their
eyes met.</p>

<p>Her beautiful eyes glanced quickly off,
like a sunbeam from a single eyeglass.
She turned, as if in sudden decision, and
sped like an arrow over the high moor.
May&#8217;s eyes followed her; and his soul was
in his eyes, and his body went after the
soul. One dig of the spurs nigh unseated
him, as if his spirited horse scorned such
an incitement to chivalric duty; and so, for
some twenty minutes on end they rode,
May neither gaining nor losing, and both
out of sight of the rest of the hunt. Now
and then the cry of hounds came up from
the forest-valley on the right, and May
fancied he heard below a crashing as of
bushes; but he had faith in his guiding
goddess and he took her lead.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[75]</span>The high winds whistled by his head,
and there were blue glimpses of the sea
and wide gray gleams of misty moorland;
but the soft heather made no sound of
their mad gallop, and May was conscious
of nothing else save the noble horse before
him and the flutter of the lady&#8217;s riding-habit
in the wind. Now the earth that
rushed beneath was yellow with the gorse,
now purple with the heather; here, he
would sail over a turf-bank, there, his horse
would swerve furiously from the feeling of
an Exmoor bog; where she would ride, he
would ride. This he swore to himself; but
she rode straight, and he could make no
gain. At the top of the moor, almost on
the ridge of Dunkery Beacon, was a narrow
cart-path, fenced six feet high in ferny turf,
after the usual manner of Devonshire lanes.
May saw it and exulted; this was sure to
turn her, till she found a gate at least.</p>

<p>But his beautiful chase rode up the
gentle inner incline and sailing over the
lane like a bird, was lost to sight upon the
other side.</p>

<p>&#8220;By heavens!&#8221; swore May to himself.
&#8220;She means to kill herself.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[76]</span>He rode at it and cleared the six-foot
width of lane successfully; but his horse
could not bunch his legs upon the narrow
bank beyond. He rolled down it, and May
over his head into a bank of heather.</p>

<p>The eager American prematurely began
to swear before his head struck the ground;
and before his one moderate oath was finished,
he was upon his horse and off again.
Mrs. Dehon had not even turned round
upon his disaster; but May was none the
less attracted to her by that. What was
mortal mishap to a spirit wrecked like hers?
Why should she?</p>

<p>They were riding down hill now; and
she was riding a little more carefully, favoring
her horse. But May cared neither for
his horse nor his neck by this time. Straight
down the hill he rode; and by the time
they reached the Lynn he had gained the
quarter-mile he lost. Here she had pulled
up her horse, and he pulled up his at a courteous
distance; and both sat still there, in
the quiet valley; and the noise of their
horses&#8217; breathing was louder than the rustle
of the wind in the old ash-trees around
them.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[77]</span>May wondered if his pilot was at fault;
but hardly had the thought crossed his
mind before they heard again the music of
the hounds, at full cry; and far up, two or
more miles away, toward the Countisbury
road, they saw the stag. Though so far
off, he was distinctly visible, as he paused
for one moment on the brow of the black
moor, outlined against the blue sky; then
he plunged downward, and the hounds
after him, and May&#8217;s horse trembled beneath
him; and May wondered why his
goddess was not off.</p>

<p>But instead of riding down to meet the
hunt, along the valley of the East Lynn, by
Oare Church and Brendon, she turned and
rode up in the direction of Chalk-water.
May followed; and hardly had they left
the Lynn and gone a furlong up the Chalk-water
Combe, when she struck sharp to
the right, breasting the very steepest part
of Oare Oak Hill. If she knew that he
was behind her, she did not look around;
and May again had all that he could do to
keep his guide in sight.</p>

<p>And now the event proved her skilful
venery. For as they crested Oare Oak<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[78]</span>
Hill, and the long bare swell of the moor
rolled away before them, the sharp cry of
the hounds came up like sounds of victory
in the valley just below. Well had Diana
known that either way of the Lynn would
be too full of his enemies for the now exhausted
deer to take. It must make for
Bagworthy Water. Long ere they had ridden
down the Lynn to the meeting of the
streams, the hunt would have passed; but
now, as they looked across and along the
lonely Doone Valley, they saw the full
pack far down at their feet, close by the
foaming stream.</p>

<p>Then May could see his leader whip her
horse, as if she would open the gap between
them; and he set his teeth and swore
that he would overtake her, this side the
death. And he gained on her slowly, and
the purple and yellow patches mingled to a
carpet as they whirled by him, and he felt
the springing of his horse&#8217;s haunches like
the waves of a sea; and below them, hardly
apace with them, was the hunt and the cry
of hounds. Down one last plunging valley&mdash;no,
there was another yet to cross, a deep
side-combe running transversely, its bottom<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[79]</span>
hid in ferns. But the hounds were
now abreast of them, below, and there was
no time to ride up and around. May saw
her take it; and as she did, a great shelf of
rock and turf broke off and fell into the
brook below. He saw her turn and wave
him back; it was the first notice she had
taken of him; and he rode straight at the
widened breach and took it squarely, landing
by her side. Then, without a word,
they dashed down, alongside of the slope,
and there, in upper Bagworthy Waters,
found the deer at bay, and the hounds;
but of the hunt no sign, save Nicholas
Snow, the huntsman, with reeking knife.
He had already blooded his hounds; and
now he sat meditatively upon a little rock
by the stream, his black jockey-cap in his
hands, looking at the body of the noble
stag, now lifeless, that had so lately been a
thing of speed and air. A warrantable deer
it was, and its end was not untimely.</p>

<p>May pushed his panting horse up nearer
hers. She was sitting motionless, her cheeks
already pale again, her eyes fixed far off
upon the distant moor. &#8220;Mrs. Dehon!&#8221;
said he, hat in hand.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[80]</span>The faintest possible inclination of her
head was his only response.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have to thank you for your lead,&#8221;
said May.</p>

<p>For one moment she turned her large
eyes down to him. &#8220;You ride well, sir,&#8221;
said she.</p>

<p>When the M. D. H. and others of the
hunt came up, they found these two talking
on a footing of ancient friendship.
The slot was duly cut off and presented
to Mrs. Dehon; and many compliments
fell to our hero&#8217;s share, for all of which
May gave credit to the beautiful huntress
beside him.</p>

<p>Tom Leigh cocked his eye at this, but
did not venture to present him to her after
that twenty-mile run. It were throwing
the helve after the hatchet, to present the
man after the heart. And thus it happened
that to her our hero was never introduced.</p>

<p>When Mr. Dehon arrived, some hours
later, Tom Leigh led him up. &#8220;Mr. Dehon,&#8221;
said he, &#8220;I think that you should
know my particular friend, Mr. Austin
May.&#8221; And Tom Leigh cocked his eye
again.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[81]</span>May looked at the pursy little old man,
and felt that his hatred for him would only
be buried in his enemy&#8217;s grave. But his
enemy was magnanimous, and promptly
asked them both to dinner, which May did
not scruple to accept.</p>

PERSEUS AND ANDROMEDA.</h3>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Austin May</span> fell devoutly in love with
Mrs. Dehon. This was without doubt the
<i>grande passion</i> of his life. And it was hopeless.</p>

<p>He was just at the age when such affairs
are sternest realities to modern men. He
was beyond the uncertainty of youth, and
before the compromises and practicalities
of middle life. And there was something
about Gladys Dehon to make a man who
cared for her ride rough-shod, neck or
nothing, over all things else. All the world
admired her; would have loved her had it
dared. There was no daring about it in
Austin&#8217;s case; his audacity was not self-conscious;
he simply followed her as he had
followed her over combe and beacon on
that Exmoor day.</p>

<p>People could tell him little about her, save<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[83]</span>
that she had been very poor and very
proud, and was very beautiful. Gladys
Darcy&mdash;that had been her name&mdash;last of a
broken family of Devon and of Ireland.
She had neither sister nor brother, only a
broken-down father, long since sold out of
his Household captaincy. She had sold
herself to Terwilliger Dehon, the rich speculator;
and she was his, as a cut diamond
might have been his; bought with his money,
shining in his house, and he no more within
her secret self than he might have been
within the diamond&#8217;s brilliant surface. And
two months after the wedding her old
father had died and made the sacrifice in
vain. Then she became the personage that
the world knew as the &#8220;beautiful Mrs.
Dehon.&#8221; May used to dream and ponder
about her, long hours of nights and days;
and he fancied that something about her
life, her lonely bringing-up, her father&#8217;s
precepts, had made her scornfully incredulous
of there being such a thing as the
novelist&#8217;s love in life. She had been a
greater nature than her father, and all mankind
had been nothing to her as compared
with even him. Too early scorn of this<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[84]</span>
world&#8217;s life prepares the soul for evil compromises.</p>

<p>Her character, her nature, she expressed
in no way whatever. She had neither intimate
friends, charitable occupations, tastes,
follies, nor faults. She shone with a certain
scornful glitter of splendor, but even of old
Dehon&#8217;s millions she was not prodigal.
She never flirted; she never looked at one
man long enough for that. Her one occupation
was hunting, and she rode to hounds
in a way to jar the nerves of every M. F. H.
in England.</p>

<p>Tom Leigh was afraid of her; and when
they were asked for a week&#8217;s visit that autumn,
in their box in Leicestershire, refused
to go. May went. And if there was a man
of whom she was not utterly unconscious,
he surely was the one. Perhaps there was
something about his way that she liked.
For, with neither much speech, delay, nor
artifice, our hero made his heart and soul
up into a small packet and threw them into
her deep eyes; and when she looked at him,
he had them; and when she looked away,
they were gone. And this he did perfectly
frankly and directly, but without spoken<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[85]</span>
words. The world saw it as clearly as did
she, and liked him none the less for it. He
was quite incapable of any effort to conceal
it; old Terwilliger might have seen it had
he been so minded. Possibly he did, and
the knowledge lent an added value to his
chattel in the old stockbroker&#8217;s mind. Mrs.
Dehon herself treated May with perfect
simplicity, but with an infinite gentleness,
as the moon-goddess might have looked
upon Endymion.</p>

<p>This state of things got to be perfectly
well known to the world. Such things
always are well known to the world; nothing
is more striking than the perfect openness
with which our heart-histories are revealed
in modern life, except perhaps the ease with
which those most intimately concerned
maintain a polite and unembarrassed appearance
of utter ignorance upon the subject.
All the world loves a lover, particularly
a hopeless one; and it was quite the
<i>mot d&#8217;ordre</i> of society that year for people to
ask Mrs. Dehon and the handsome American
to their houses together.</p>

<p>And Mrs. Dehon? Well, before the coming
of spring she felt a great and trustful<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[86]</span>
friendship for this incidental castaway upon
the waters of her troubled life. May afterward
remembered that she told him many
things about herself; and she had spoken
of herself to no one else before, her own
father included. She even let him see a
little of her heart. And it is an axiom that
he who sees ever so little of a woman&#8217;s
heart has but to take it. Seeing is possession.
This is the wisdom of the fair Melusine,
and other wise old medi&aelig;val myths.</p>

<p>It is needless to say that May had absolutely
forgotten the Countess de Valska;
more completely than even she had forgotten
the Siberian mausoleum of her Serge.
If May thought of her once in that year, it
was to dismiss her memory with a curse
for his own folly, and a mental oath that no
Trouvillian countess would part him, should
his way ever be clear to Gladys Darcy. He
would not recognize the hated name of
Dehon, even in his thoughts.</p>

<p>In his despair, he confided in Tom Leigh
again. Tom saw no reason to change his
previous opinion. The hole seemed if
anything deeper, now that two were in it.
&#8220;I don&#8217;t see but what you&#8217;ve got to escape<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[87]</span>
the countess, bring Serge to life, kill old
Terwilliger, and thus give her two years&#8217;
mourning,&#8221; said he. &#8220;Why the deuce didn&#8217;t
you find her out first?&#8221; he added, ruefully.
&#8220;Old Terwilliger only married her eighteen
months ago.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know,&#8221; said May. &#8220;Why don&#8217;t
you invent his railway schemes, and discover
his Cornish mines?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;True,&#8221; assented Tom. &#8220;Old Dehon always
does get in on the ground floor. However,&#8221;
he added, brightening up, &#8220;if you
can marry her, you&#8217;ll get her and his money,
too.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Damn his money,&#8221; said May.</p>

<p>Tom looked shocked, and changed the
subject, and May&#8217;s heart continued so to
bleed internally that soon Gladys Dehon&#8217;s
marble brow would soften to pity as she
saw him wane. Meantime Terwilliger&#8217;s
capon-lined stomach waxed apace, and even
his digestion was to all appearance unimpaired.</p>

<p>Now, it is probable that ours is the first
civilization known to history where this
state of things could exist, be mutually
known, and continue in tranquil permanency.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[88]</span>
But it does&mdash;that is, it nearly always
does&mdash;and it is a credit, after all, to our
teaching and our times that it does so. The
ancient Perseus cut Andromeda&#8217;s chains,
and departed with her by the next P. and
O. steamer they could signal; the modern
one sits down on the strand beside her, and
he and Andromeda die to slow music&mdash;that
is, in case either should chance to die before
the malady is cured. And Andromeda&#8217;s
master relies on the strength of his chains
and on Perseus&#8217;s good bringing-up, and is
not wholly displeased at the situation. Particularly
for a sly old stock-broker like Terwilliger
Dehon, whose idea of values is
based on the opinion of the street, a Perseus
to his Andromeda is half the fun. The
world, on the whole, approves the situation;
but the husband Dehon is not a popular
character, and it likes the Perseus better.
Not, of course, that it is willing to condone
anything improper, particularly on the
part of Andromeda.</p>

<p>But Austin May stood the passive r&ocirc;le for
precisely twelve months; and then he made
up his mind that something would have to
break. He hoped it might be the neck of old<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[89]</span>
Terwilliger; but Providence seldom spoils
a dramatic situation by so simple a denouement.
And, to tell the truth, considering
the way the three rode to hounds, it was
much more likely to be his own or Gladys&#8217;s.
One thing was sure: their triangular relations
were too strained to continue. He
came to this conclusion after one precisely
similar day upon Exmoor, a year after their
first meeting; except that upon this occasion
the deer took to the sea below Glenthorne
and was drowned, and he and Gladys
rode homeward side by side in silence.</p>

<p>Accordingly, that night Austin May wrote
a letter; and in the morning showed Terwilliger
a telegram from America, took his
departure, shook hands hard with old Terwilliger,
barely touched the slender fingers
of his wife, but, when he did so, left the
letter in her hand. May kept no copy of
this letter; but he remembered it very well.
It ran as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>&#8220;<span class="smcap">Gladys</span>:</p>

<p>&#8220;I must not stay in England any more.
I cannot bear it. I know that you are unhappy,
and I must go where, at least, I shall<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[90]</span>
not see it. Nor can I trust myself with you
after our ride of yesterday.</p>

<p>&#8220;Remember always that, wherever I am,
I am always and only yours. This is a very
strange thing to say; but I think there are
times when men and women should show
each other their hearts, however much the
truth may shock the prudes and pedants.
And I do very much wish to say that if ever
you are free, I ask you to marry me.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is a sad thing that the circumstances
of your wedded life are such that I can say
these things to you and not offend you.
But you have shown me enough of your
heart for this.</p>

<p>&#8220;I go now into Asia. A trivial duty will
call me to my family home for one day, on
August 14, 1886. Then, if I do not hear of
you there, I shall disappear again. After
that I shall write you once a year.</p>

<p class="right"><span class="indentright">&#8220;Good-by,</span><br />

&AElig;NEAS AND CAMILLA.</h3>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Poor</span> Austin! A boy&#8217;s love feeds on the
romance of hopelessness, flourishes apace
in the shadow of despair; it delights in
patient waiting, in faithful fidelity, in lapses
of years; but a man&#8217;s is peremptory, immediate,
uncompromising. Some secret
instinct bids a Romeo to contemplate a
tragedy with cheerfulness; and ten to one
that his years of gloom change, as they fall
behind him, to &#8220;<i>un joli souvenir</i>.&#8221; But a
man, middle-aged, knows when he wants
his Dulcinea, and he wants her here and
now. No glamour of blighted affections
can make up for the hard facts of life to
him.</p>

<p>When a middle-aged man can&#8217;t get the
woman he wants, there are three recognized
and respectable courses open to him. He
works a little harder, plays a good deal<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[94]</span>
harder, or he marries someone else. The
last was out of the question for a man so
consumed by the fires of passion as Austin
May, but the fuel of his heart was transformed
into nervous energy of the entire
system. He plunged again, like a rocket,
into a rapid and circuitous course of travel
and adventure; and, after a brilliant career
through the remote East, descended, like a
burned-out stick, some fifteen months later,
in San Francisco. Thence he went home.</p>

<p>The fact was, he wanted rest. His heart
was tired of throbbing, his head weary with
thinking. And all his mad adventure had
only tired the body, had made him sleep at
night, nothing more. He had been through
the world again, but Gladys Dehon was all
of it to him. He thought of her now with
a certain dull pain&mdash;less madly, more hopelessly,
than in England the two years before.</p>

<p>He could not bear to go back to his home.
He went to Boston, and he saw his lawyers;
but he did not go out to Brookline. This
he vowed he would not do until that day
when he had promised Gladys he would
be there. He did not forget that he had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[95]</span>
promised the countess, too; but he was no
longer so much troubled by the countess.
He would kill her, if necessary.</p>

<p>Meantime, he went to pass the winter in
New York. He had himself elected a member
of two fashionable clubs. He followed
the hounds in Long Island and in Jersey.
He went to dinners and he danced at Germans,
albeit with an aching heart. He renaturalized
himself; he made friends with
his countrymen, and he studied his countrywomen.
He got himself once more <i>d&eacute;sorient&eacute;</i>
in American society. He observed
what respect was everywhere shown to the
VanDees, and how little, comparatively, one
thought of the McDums. He found that
civilization was pitched on a higher scale,
financially, than he had supposed. Thirty
thousand a year was none too much for a
man to marry on. Now, Austin had not
over twenty thousand, even if he fulfilled
the hard conditions of his uncle&#8217;s will.</p>

<p>He took an interest in yachting, and gave
orders for a cutter that was to beat the prevailing
style of sloop. He also imported a
horse or two, and entered one of them at
Sheepshead Bay. He had a luxuriously<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[96]</span>
furnished flat, near Madison Square. He
went to St. Augustine in the spring, with
the VanDees, and while there was introduced
to Georgiana Rutherford. He saw
her afterward in New York, and early in
June he asked her to marry him.</p>

<p>Miss Rutherford was a young lady of supreme
social position, great wealth, and
beauty. She had for two years been the
leading newspaper belle of New York society.
Her movements, her looks, her
dresses, the state of her health, the probable
state of her affections&mdash;everything about
her, to the very dimples in her white shoulders&mdash;had
been chronicled with crude precision
in the various metropolitan journals
having pretensions to <i>haut ton</i> (for high tone
is not a good translation), and had thence
been eagerly copied throughout the provincial
weeklies of the land. Miss Rutherford
was absolutely a person to be desired.</p>

<p>It would not be fair to May to say that he
was false to Gladys Dehon. His passion for
her, too vehement, had fairly burned itself
out. In the two years since he had left her,
May&#8217;s heart had, as it were, banked its volcanic
fires. However fissured were its ravined<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">[97]</span>
depths, the surface was at rest, and the
lava-flood that concealed it was already cool.
And a beautiful huntswoman who had ridden
out of sight of her first husband, as had
Gladys Dehon, was not at all the sort of
person for middle-aged Austin May to marry
and bring to Boston. These things he felt
for some weeks before he proposed to Miss
Rutherford, and she was precisely the sort
of girl he saw was best. If old Uncle Austin
had selected her himself, he could not
have made a better choice. And well,
thought May, he saw the motives of his
kind old uncle&#8217;s will, and the wisdom born
of much experience, and long consideration
and a knowledge of Eclipse claret that had
prompted it. A young man, if left to himself,
would choose him a different wife for
each three years of his life. It is only after
he has run the gamut of all impossibilities
that he settles down upon the proper thing.
And this, at last, May felt assured that he
had done.</p>

<p>May did not pretend to himself that he
loved Georgiana Rutherford as he had loved
Gladys Dehon. Even now, he was not blind
to that. But he thought that she was pretty,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[98]</span>
and well-placed, and good style; and she
had a large fortune, and a still larger family
connection, all of the very best securities.</p>

<p>In fact, May, at least so far as he admitted
to himself, did not do justice to the qualities
of Miss Rutherford. Miss Rutherford was
a very charming girl; much cleverer and
much better educated, to say nothing of her
style and beauty, than any embryo Gladys
Dehon that May had ever seen. She was
perfectly mistress of her own heart, as she
was of her own fortune, and it was dangerous
to present to her foreigners, lest they
afterward shot themselves. They always
went wild about her; much to Miss Rutherford&#8217;s
discomfort. Some would besiege her;
others would curse her; others, still, say
evil things about her in the true Parisian
manner. Miss Rutherford remained &#8220;more
than usual calm&#8221; through it all.</p>

<p>She had the reputation of being a flirt,
but it was not so. She tried her adorers,
Portia-like, successively; the moment that
they failed to reach a certain standard, it
was entirely right and fair for her to drop
them. Some of them would cry that they
were hurt, and these she contemned from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[99]</span>
her very soul. She did not regard such
matters as subjects for tears. Marriage was
a step in life, like any other, and only deserved
more serious consideration because
it was final.</p>

<p>This was the woman whose love was to
make heart-haven for Austin May; the serious,
sober choice of his manhood, after all
his boyish follies were past. He had told
her very seriously and politely of his desire
to marry her, one Sunday evening, on the
piazza of a house at Newport. It was
necessary for him to speak in a low tone,
as the people of the house were not far off.
She was silent for some seconds, and then
he had kissed her.</p>

<p>But here came in the first really difficult
thing to do in the whole proceeding. Not,
indeed, the kissing her. But how was he to
tell her of the countess and Gladys Dehon?
And yet he must tell her, if only to explain
the necessary delay in announcing their engagement.
He looked at her in the light
that came from the late sunset; how perfectly
of the great world she was! He could
not bear to lose her now; she was just such
a wife as he would invent for himself, had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[100]</span>
she not existed. She was sitting silently, in
a pose that was full of grace and training;
much too finely bred to be blushing because
he had kissed her. No man had ever kissed
her before; and yet, when she deemed that
the occasion had come when she could fitly
let one do it, she no more blushed because
she had so resolved than she would blush at
entering a ball-room.</p>

<p>Then he pulled himself together, and told
her very calmly the history of his life. She
was greatly interested, and listened with attention
and sympathy.</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course, you must be there&mdash;on August
14th, I mean.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And keep my word?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That,&#8221; said Miss Rutherford, &#8220;I must
leave to you. You can&#8217;t keep your word
with both of them.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;After all,&#8221; said May, hopefully, &#8220;they
may not come.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You surely do not expect them to cross
the Atlantic in person to meet you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, no!&#8221; said May. &#8220;They won&#8217;t do
that&mdash;but they may write or telegraph.&#8221;
But May did not feel sure what Mme. Polacca
de Valska might or might not do.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[101]</span>&#8220;At all events,&#8221; said she, &#8220;I think our
engagement had better not come out until
after the 14th of August.&#8221; And May felt
constrained to admit that this was best.</p>

<p>&#8220;And I do not think that you had better
see me until then.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What?&#8221; cried Austin.</p>

<p>But Miss Rutherford was firm. She would
not have him with her every day unless she
could tell people that they were engaged.
What was she to say to the world if, after
that 14th of August, he were to be engaged
to Mrs. Dehon, for instance? This she delicately
hinted; but, moreover, she told him
she had promised to visit the Larneds, at
Pomfret, and the Charles Mt. Vernons, at
Beverly, and to spend three weeks with the
Breezes, at Mount Desert, in August. He
could not trail about after her; and it was
only three months, after all. So May had
consented, with an ill grace; and when she
left, two days later, he found nothing better
than to join VanKnyper on a yachting
cruise. Then he had gone up on the Restigouche,
salmon-fishing; and on the 12th of
August he was in the Maine woods.</p>

THE IDYL OF ANTEROS.</h3>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">In</span> the leisure of the forest, Austin May
reflected&mdash;for the first time comprehensively&mdash;upon
his conduct of life. It seemed to
him that the only sensible action of many
wasted years was his getting engaged to
Georgiana Rutherford; and yet, for the moment,
it rather added to his perplexities.
He felt convinced that Tom Leigh would
say it put him in a greater hole than ever.
Here was he engaged to three women at
once, and all the engagements matured upon
the fourteenth day of August proximo.
Why is it that there is not such a thing as
the making an assignment for the benefit of
one&#8217;s heart&#8217;s creditors? He might then
place himself in the hands of some respectable
chaperone as assignee, and pay each of
the contracting parties thirty-three per cent.
Or he might even get a composition, or an<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">[103]</span>
extension at long time. Possibly the other
two would assign their claims to Georgiana.
If she were the sole creditor, he fancied
that they might effect an arrangement.
She certainly had the only lien on the few
remaining assets of his hard-worked ventricles.</p>

<p>Georgiana Rutherford! What a perfectly
civilized creature she was. How well
she would look at the end of the state dining-table
in the Brookline house, with the
&eacute;pergne in front of her. Then how gracefully
she would sweep out, at the head of
the procession of ladies&mdash;Brookline ladies,
with a guest or two from Boston or Jamaica
Plains&mdash;and leave him and his friends to
their bachelor-talk and cigars. But first,
after being married, he had promised to
take her up the Nile. May had already
been up the Nile.</p>

<p>May slipped off the rock into the rushing
river. He had got to thinking, in the absence
of salmon, and forgotten his whereabouts.
It was clumsy of him, he reflected, as
his boots queaked soddenly campward. He
was getting heavy, and slow, and middle-aged.
And suddenly he felt a yearning for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">[104]</span>
the wilds, for wilder wilds even than Aroostook
County. He had been now for six
years in high civilizations&mdash;Japan, India,
England, or, at worst, the States. There
were several dreams of his scheming-time
not yet effected. Among others, a trip
from Hudson&#8217;s Bay, in canoes, through the
Great Slave lake to the Pacific. He was
almost on the ground, with good guides
and an outfit; why not start at once? But
there was the fourteenth of August next to
come, he reflected.</p>

<p>A strange wagon was in the camp when
he got back; a single buckboard from the
nearest settlement, and it bore a pretty
girl. May had conversation with her. A
veritable Lady of the Aroostook was she;
not over-idealized, like the heroine of Mr.
Howells. Really, she had a certain rudimentary
charm. Suppose, thought May,
I were to make her my dusky bride? For
dusky, read freckled.</p>

<p>By Jove, thought May&mdash;an idea indeed.
If he gave it out as such? If, in consideration
of a trip to Boston, new bonnets, and
a junket of quite Merovingian dimensions,
she were to consent to go to Brookline and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[105]</span>
personate his bride, for that day only? How
natural that he, at the very end of his eleven
years, should have plunged into nature and
married la premi&egrave;re venue. It was just the
thing, he felt assured his friends would say,
that he was certain to do. Why, even the
heroes of the Lady of Aroostook did as
much. And even the Comtesse Polacca
dei Cascadegli de Valska could have nothing
to reply to such a living argument as
this Maine girl would present. My wife&mdash;Mrs.
Austin May. Gladys Dehon would
scorn, but believe. And then, having nobly
earned her reward, his salvatress might retire
to her primitive forest decked with new
fal-lals to astound the rustic breast.</p>

<p>But now, confound it, here as always, the
cursed conventions rose in his way. The
proprieties were ever his fatality, a very
ghost of Banquo at the feast of life. Why
had he been born in Boston? True, they
had once saved him from the countess;
but now they were to offer him a humble
sacrifice to her unlovely years. For she
came first chronologically, and she was certain
to come first in fact.</p>

<p>May had no further ideas; and he had to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[106]</span>
leave his river at the height of the salmon
season.</p>

<p>We have told how, on the 14th of August,
he arrived at Brookline, true to his appointment
with all three. He got to Boston
late in the evening before, went to his club,
passed a sleepless night, and took an early
morning train for Brookline, as we have
seen.</p>

<p>And, perhaps, as we have also seen, a
much more awkward thing than this had
happened. Austin May was there, ready
to meet any one of them. The period of
probation required by the will had elapsed.</p>

<p>But as May travelled up to the city in
that hot weather, he had been wondering
to himself which and how many of them
he should see, and it had become very clear
to him that he did not feel the least desire
to see any one of the three.</p>

<p>His uncle&#8217;s will had well been justified.
With shocked shamefacedness he thought
of the countess, that Trouville heroine that
he believed to be little better than an adventuress,
a gambler, tracked by the police.
And Mrs. Dehon&mdash;well, if Mrs. Dehon were
to ride madly up that quiet Boston lawn,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[107]</span>
May felt sure that he should flee in terror.
And Georgiana Rutherford&mdash;now that
it came to the point, and after his three
months&#8217; consideration, May did not feel
that he wished to marry even Georgiana
Rutherford.</p>

<p>He gave little thought to his impending
doom, still less thought of escaping it. He
was as one who had been released eleven
years upon parole, and must now give himself
up to be shot. He even gave himself
little curiosity as to whose the fatal bullet
would prove to be. A man ordered out
with a file of soldiers to be executed looks
upon the levelled row of muzzles with an
absolute impartiality. He was in the position
of the celebrated d&#8217;Artagnan, who, having
three duels in the Pr&eacute; aux Clercs, and
certain of being killed by Athos at 12, gave
himself little anxiety about Porthos, who
was to follow at 12.15, or Aramis, who was
only due at 12.30.</p>

<p>But, as the day wore on, and the reaction
followed the artificial strength given by
many cigars, his state of mind had approximated
to an abject and unreasoning terror.
And in this mood he was, late in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[108]</span>
afternoon, when he turned and saw, stationary
before his front door, that carriage,
with its footman in livery.</p>

<p>His one instinct was to conceal himself.
Nervously he grabbed the heavy &#8220;Burton&#8217;s
Anatomy;&#8221; the secret door swung open;
the fountain in the lake began to play, and
in a score of seconds May was hiding in its
cool and watery depths.</p>

THE UNCERTAIN GLORY OF A NEW YORK
GIRL.</h3>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">When</span> May emerged in the little grass
island, screened safely by the play of falling
waters, he was breathless with the run; and
his heart pounded against his ribs with the
violence of his emotions. The countess it
unquestionably was. None but she would
arrive in open carriage and pair and splendid
livery. And May reckoned he would
have to stay there, in the shelter of the
fountain, until the light made his escape
safe and possible. As for seeing her, that
was out of the question. Had he still cared
for Mrs. Dehon, he might have choked off
the other one; but he had not pluck for it
now. He had mildly hoped that Gladys
and the countess might have arrived at the
same time and settled it between them; but
Allah had willed otherwise. It was damp<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">[110]</span>
and uncomfortable upon the little island,
however, without even a cigar; and he did
not dare go back to the pavilion.</p>

<p>As he stood peering through the falling
water the carriage turned about, left the
house, and came down the driveway. May
was astounded. He tried his best to see
who was in it, but the distance was too
great. He fancied that he made out a figure
upon the back seat, but it was that of
a young man. He was surely too young
for Serge; but, possibly, Serge had left a
son. This, indeed, was extremely probable.
And the son was gone to the gate to
await more formal introduction to his papa-in-law;
and had left the countess in the
house.</p>

<p>This was the most terrible possibility that
had yet occurred to his fevered imagination,
overwrought with suspense and too much
tobacco as it was. For a moment the idea
of the buggy and the fast horse in the stable
presented itself as the only certain means of
escape. But at the same instant he saw
Fides emerge from the side-door, carrying
something white in his mouth. The hound
came to the door of the pavilion and scratched<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">[111]</span>
there; not finding any response, he took to
coursing around the building, in wider and
wider distances, until his circle included the
whole pond. When he had once more made
the circuit of this, without getting trail of his
master, he lifted his nose from the ground
to give utterance to occasional lugubrious
howls.</p>

<p>This was impossible. Something must
be done at once, or his chief retreat would
be discovered. May rapidly descended
through the subterranean passage, and appearing
at the door of the pavilion, whistled
softly. The dog bounded toward him, and
May took the letter from his mouth. It
was accompanied with a card of &#8220;Mr. Burlington
Quincy,&#8221; as May hurriedly read.
Now, Mr. Burlington Quincy bore a name
utterly unknown to Austin May.</p>

<p>He looked at the note. It was certainly
not in the handwriting of Madame Polacca
de Valska, and May breathed a sigh of relief.
He opened it.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>&#8220;<span class="smcap">My dear Mr. May</span>: (it began)</p>

<p>&#8220;I know you will not misinterpret my action,
when I write to tell you that our engagement<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">[112]</span>
cannot be made known to-day.
The bearer of this, Mr. Burlington Quincy,
of Boston, I did not know when our pleasant
acquaintance began last year, but I
feel sure that he is the only man I have
ever&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
</div>

<p>&#8220;Loved,&#8221; added May to himself, mechanically,
as the first page came to an end.
Without troubling himself to read any
further, he merely looked at the signature,
which was, &#8220;yours ever sincerely, Georgiana
Rutherford.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Bah!&#8221; said Austin to himself again, and
he crumpled up the letter and threw it
upon the pedestal of the Venus of Milo.
A very different sort of girl from Georgy
Rutherford, she looked at him with an air
of dignity offended by his flippancy. Certainly
a great weight was off his mind, even
if it did leave behind the faintest conceivable
smart of irritation. One, at least, was
disposed of satisfactorily, and he threw himself
into the great arm-chair with a sigh of
relief. He wished Miss Rutherford joy of
her bargain, though he could not but think
it ill-bred of her to choose the replacing
victim as the messenger of his release. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">[113]</span>
only man she had ever loved, indeed! And
who was Mr. Burlington Quincy? Well, it
mattered little to him.</p>

<p>May looked at his watch; it was seven
o&#8217;clock. Only five hours more of this
awful day remained! His condition was
one of absolute nervous prostration; and
he looked in a glass to see if his hair had
yet turned gray. Could it be that they
would none of them appear? He felt
almost hungry, but that eating was out of
the question for one in his position. He
could, however, take a biscuit and a glass of
claret; and this he did.</p>

<p>But May was fated that day to have hard
luck with his uncle&#8217;s wine. Hardly had he
begun to sip the glass, when a loud knocking
at the very door of his pavilion made
him drop it, and again seek refuge in his
fountain hiding-place. From there he looked
through the jets of water and saw that
the knocker was none other than the faithful
Schmidt.</p>

<p>May hastened back again to the pavilion
and opened the door.</p>

<p>&#8220;What do you mean by this?&#8221; said he,
angrily. &#8220;Did I not tell you not to come<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">[114]</span>
out under any circumstances, unless you
heard a pistol-shot?&#8221;</p>

<p>But, alas! The effect of the solitude, the
heat, and the excitement of his master&#8217;s
strange behavior had been too much, even
for the perfect valet. Moreover, he had
felt it his duty to finish all his master&#8217;s so
precipitately abandoned bottles, lest they
should fall into the hands of the enemy.
If Mr. Schmidt was not tipsy, it was clear
that he soon would be. He had been leaning
heavily against the door, and as his
master opened it suddenly, he fell into the
room, head over heels to the floor; and
there, without getting up, he endeavored to
bow apologetically, and swayed to and fro
with the effort, smiling a meaningless smile
and holding a visiting-card in his right
hand. May took it mechanically. It was
edged in deep black; and upon it he read
the simple legend:</p>

<p class="center"><i>Mrs. Terwilliger Dehon</i>.</p>

THE KEEPING OF THE TRYST.</h3>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">May</span> grasped the half-drunken valet by
the coat. &#8220;And you let her in?&#8221; said he.</p>

<p>&#8220;I said, m&#8217;sieu&#8217;,&#8221; gasped out poor Schmidt,
&#8220;that m&#8217;sieu&#8217;, was here.&#8221;</p>

<p>With a groan of mingled rage and terror,
May flew to the door and made it fast.
Then he took Schmidt by his offending
coat and shoved, rather than led, him into
the subaqueous passageway. When they
emerged upon the island, May said, with a
final shake:</p>

<p>&#8220;Now, sir, go and tell all the world that
I&#8217;m not at home&mdash;d&#8217;ye hear? And come
back and tell me; and that you may come
back sober, I&#8217;ll clear your thick head for
you.&#8221; And suiting the action to the word,
May hurled poor Schmidt through the cool
jets of the fountain; and he disappeared
with a startling plunge in the waters of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">[116]</span>
ornamental lake. They were but a few feet
deep, however, and Schmidt scrambled to
his feet and went wading through the lily-pads
to the shore. And in a few moments
he came back, still wet, but quite sobered, to
the brink nearest the island.</p>

<p>&#8220;What does she say?&#8221; cried May.</p>

<p>&#8220;That she will wait for M&#8217;sieur,&#8221; came
back the answer that May heard; and he
sank upon the rustic seat with a feeling that
all was over with him. Should he still fly?
He could not bring himself to break his
word at this late hour. If it could be that
the widowed Mrs. Dehon had come all this
distance&mdash;unwomanly as it was&mdash;he could
not leave her now. Moreover, it was exactly
like her. She was just the woman to take
the leap herself, rather than trust herself and
her heart-secrets to written words. And as
May pulled himself together and went toward
the house he wished he could have
conjured back one spark of that flame he
once felt for her. His crusty old uncle
had not foreseen that thus, by the rash
heir&#8217;s promise, the wise provisions of his
will could be evaded. What would his
wise uncle have done in a similar situation?&mdash;Ordered<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">[117]</span>
a monument at Mount Auburn
and prepared the remains for it afterward,
perhaps. His head was too cloudy
to think.</p>

<p>May reached the doors of the house. It
was already dark; and he had one last moment
of hesitation as he pressed his hand
upon the carved-oak door-knob. Then,
with a rally of his sense of honor, he turned
it and entered the house.</p>

<p>The great hall was quite dark; and Austin
had to feel his way to the dining-room,
into which, as being the only habitable
apartment, Schmidt had had to show the
fair Gladys. Here was a single candle
burning; and beyond the remains of what
was evidently Schmidt&#8217;s dinner, just under
the Copley portrait of the lady in the lilac
dress, sat a solitary figure.</p>

<p>But May started back as he saw it. It
certainly was not Gladys. It was&mdash;it was a
man; and as it rose and came forward to the
candle-light there appeared unmistakably
the red face and pudgy figure of her elderly
husband! For a moment the joyous reaction
held May speechless; but then he
sprang forward.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">[118]</span>&#8220;Mr. Terwilliger Dehon, I am delighted
to&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>But Terwilliger waved him back with the
gesture of an M.P. quelling an assembly of
constituents; and in his hand he carried a
letter. &#8220;May I ask, Mr. May, what is the
meaning of this?&#8221; And Dehon brought
the offending document close beneath May&#8217;s
nose, lying upon his chubby palm; and then
slapped it violently with his other hand.</p>

<p>&#8220;Of this?&#8221; said May, innocently. &#8220;What
is it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That, sir, is a letter I found among my
wife&#8217;s effects.&#8221; And beyond all question the
letter was in May&#8217;s own handwriting. May
stared helplessly at Dehon; and Terwilliger
glared fixedly at May. And through all
the embarrassment of the situation loomed
up May&#8217;s consciousness, antagonistic as
their meeting was, that he was uncommonly
glad to see him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Is&mdash;is Mrs. Dehon with you?&#8221; said May,
feebly, as the awful possibility occurred to
him that they had been divorced.</p>

<p>&#8220;My beloved wife is in heaven,&#8221; said
Dehon, pulling out a large pocket-handkerchief
and sinking back into his chair.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">[119]</span>&#8220;My dear sir,&#8221; cried May, grasping both
his hands, &#8220;I am&mdash;unfeignedly sorry to
hear it. When did&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That, sir,&#8221; cried Terwilliger, furiously,
&#8220;is no answer to my question. Did you, or
did you not, write this letter?&#8221; And he
jumped from his chair and smacked the
letter savagely against the dinner-table.</p>

<p>Evasion was impossible. &#8220;I am afraid,
Mr. Dehon, that I did.&#8221; Dehon fumed.</p>

<p>&#8220;And now, my dear sir,&#8221; said May, his
face unconsciously broadening to a smile,
&#8220;will you not stay and dine with me? I
have only&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>But at this the peppery old gentleman
positively sailed off the floor in his passion.
In vain May told him that he had received
nothing from the late Mrs. Dehon but a
long course of snubs; in vain May assured
him that he himself was more delighted than
ever Mr. Dehon could be, that there had
never been a possibility of his marrying the
lamented Gladys; it was to no purpose that
he besought him to stay and dine. He tried
to sympathize with Terwilliger in his loss,
and Terwilliger grew only the more infuriated.
He pointed out to him that his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">[120]</span>
letter had been entirely contingent, to take
effect solely upon Mr. Terwilliger&#8217;s death;
but upon this the old gentleman fairly
choked with rage.</p>

<p>Finally poor Austin gave it up. He
abandoned all effort to pacify him, and listened
submissively to the philippic the indignant
Terwilliger poured forth. And, to
use the expressive but inelegant phrase of
the day, he blew himself off right well. Austin
sat and listened with a mind at peace.</p>

<p>A man&#8217;s own eloquence is a great relief,
and there is no knowing how far Mr. Dehon
would have cooled off in time. It is possible
that he would have ended by staying
to dinner. But, just as he was finishing a
most effective exordium, the noise of carriage-wheels
was heard outside upon the
gravel.</p>

<p>In two strides May was at the window,
had thrown open the sash with a crash that
shivered all the glass, and hurled himself
through it into outer darkness, leaving the
astounded Mr. Dehon, one eloquent arm extended
in the air, addressing himself most
earnestly to the four Copley portraits and
the two battle-pieces of indigestible fruit.</p>

THE RETURN OF THE COUNTESS.</h3>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Beyond</span> all question this was now the
Comtesse Polacca de Valska. She was the
only one left. All others were present or
accounted for. Again May gained his pavilion,
with the fleetness of an Exmoor deer;
it was quite dark by this time, and he could
run about fearlessly. With a trembling hand
he adjusted his dark-lantern, lit the lamp, and
fixed the focus full upon the house-front
door.</p>

<p>He was just in time to see a veiled and
much beshawled lady assisted down from
the vehicle that stood at the door; and after
a word of colloquy with the driver, she entered
the house. May could not see her
face; but it was just the figure, he fancied,
of the Countess de Valska. The carriage
drove away, the front door closed, and all
again was silent, save the thumping of poor
Austin&#8217;s strained and shaken heart. Great<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">[122]</span>
heavens! he complained to the harmless
Venus of Milo. The worst had been realized
indeed.</p>

<p>This time there was no indecision. The
only safety lay in flight. When it came to
the point of marrying the de Valska, he
would be damned if he would. No sooner
had he gained this conclusion than he
sought to put it in practice. With quick
and stealthy steps he gained the stable. A
drive of fifteen miles to Framingham would
put him on the New York train; and the
Umbria sailed on the morrow. Little difficulties
with countesses were better understood
on European shores.</p>

<p>But alas! it was only to find that the
stable-door was locked. He could hear inside
the noises of a restless horse, but both
fast horse and buggy were beyond his reach.
The over-cautious Schmidt had locked them
in, and taken the key. May&#8217;s heart sank.
He looked around for an axe, a log, anything
to batter down the door with&mdash;he
would have set fire to his own stable if
necessary; then a brilliant thought occurred
to him&mdash;of the pistol-shot that was to be the
signal to Schmidt in cases of emergency.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">[123]</span>He ran back to the pavilion. As he passed
the house he thought he heard sounds of
angry collocation in the entry. But this
was no time for idle curiosity; and he ran
on to the pavilion, grasped the revolver,
ran back before the house, placed himself in
the little clump of pines, and fired. The
noises in the house ceased. He fired again.</p>

<p>The second report of his revolver was followed
by a wild and shrill screaming in the
house. A second after, the front door was
violently flung open, and Mr. Terwilliger
Dehon burst forth with the celerity of a
pellet from a pop-gun. He was immediately
and closely pursued by a female figure,
screaming violently. After her, all in
the focus of the dark-lantern, appeared a
gaunt and stooping individual with a shot-gun,
which he brought to his shoulder and
incontinently fired, aiming, as far as May
could judge, at the North Star. Then he
threw away the shot-gun and joined in the
pursuit; and after him came the faithful
Schmidt, in obedience to his master&#8217;s signal,
once more unperturbed.</p>

<p>&#8220;What has happened?&#8221; cried May, rushing
forward. &#8220;Where is she?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">[124]</span>But even as he spoke, feminine arms were
thrown around his neck, a fainting feminine
figure hung about his shoulder, and feminine
lips whispered in his ear:</p>

<p>&#8220;At last!&#8221;</p>

<p>With a gasp of despair, May disengaged
her and led her to the front door, where he
deposited his precious burden upon the
china garden-seat. The countess seemed
less graceful than of yore, and she certainty
was heavier. But the countess, of course
it was.</p>

<p>&#8220;Sech a time, Mr. May,&#8221; said she. &#8220;Me
a-comin&#8217; up with the d&eacute;p&ocirc;t-man, and findin&#8217;
a burglar in the house; an&#8217; the volleys from
the ambushes as was outside; an&#8217; Mr. Eastman
a-runnin&#8217; for his gun, an&#8217; I chasin&#8217; the
burglar; an&#8217; all along of that furriner in the
kitchen as left the cellar-door wide open;
an&#8217;, says I&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Mrs. Eastman!&#8221; cried May, with a sigh
of relief, as if he saw the dawn again. But
that heroine&#8217;s short-lived valor was exhausted.
To chase an elderly burglar out one&#8217;s
own front door, amid salvoes of musketry,
was surely excuse enough for leaning on
the shoulder of the first reliable male one<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">[125]</span>
met and knew; but the thought of both
actions was too much for feminine nerves,
and Mrs. Eastman proceeded to get up the
best notion of hysterics her Maine training
could produce. As for May, he was so glad
that it was not the Polacca de Valska that
he could have kissed even the elderly housekeeper;
but he thought better of it, and
consigned her to the tender soothing of her
husband.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mirandy,&#8221; he heard Mr. Eastman say,
&#8220;don&#8217;t ye be a fool!&#8221;</p>

THE ORDER OF DISCHARGE.</h3>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">May</span> went back again to his pavilion.
Great heavens, what a day! He looked at
his watch. It was already after ten o&#8217;clock;
and his heart gave a leap of joy. Could it
be that the countess would never turn up at
all?</p>

<p>He was too much shaken by the excitements
of the day to sit still quietly, and
count the minutes; so he took to wandering
in the driveway about the lake. He
was conscious of a marvellous accession of
spirits! Poor Mr. Terwilliger Dehon! And
May laughed to himself as he pictured their
meeting, and the Eastmans taking him for
a burglar. What could she have done to
drive Dehon in such terror from the house?
May wondered what had become of him,
and looked with some apprehension lest
he should have rushed into the lily-pond.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">[130]</span>
But that was impossible in so light a night.
Moreover, he could have waded out. Well,
well! he never should have known how to
get rid of him. Peace to his widower&#8217;s
weeds.</p>

<p>The harvest moon had risen, and shone
brightly on the familiar fields. Beauty is
only relished by the free. How strong and
sweet is our memory for places! Each swell
of grassy hill seemed like an old playmate;
the very contour of the masses of elm-foliage,
darkly outlined under the moon, seemed
all familiar to him. Every time that May
walked by the main gate-way, with the iron
cannon-balls, he looked nervously through
it; but the white, shady road was clean and
empty, and the night was still.</p>

<p>His fortune was almost too great to be
believed in, and he looked frequently at his
watch, and listened timidly for every sound.
Had the countess forgotten him? Had she
captured another? Well, Gladys was dead,
and Georgiana &#8220;was married;&#8221; and he sat
there, &#8220;dipping his nose in the Gascon wine&#8221;&mdash;still
seven years short of &#8220;forty year.&#8221;</p>

<p>But the night waxed and the moon rose
higher, and the white mists began to drift<span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">[131]</span>
in, stilly, from the distant river; and there
was yet no manifestation of the Countess
Polacca de Valska.</p>

<p>And at last the village church rang out
twelve bells; and the cocks crew; and May
pitched his cigar into the lake with a sigh
that resembled a benediction. The day was
over. That most terrible twenty-four hours
of his life was safely passed. He could go
to bed and sleep serenely, in the consciousness
that no one of his idle old dreams was
to be realized, that no folly of his past was
to assume shape and confront him now.
And all his arsenal of weapons, his laboratory
of drugs, his store-house of Dutch
courage, had proved unnecessary.</p>

<p>He walked along by the margent of the
little lake; and as he did so, a thought
struck him. He entered the pavilion and
set the fountain playing, in celebration of
his deliverance. He threw open all the
shutters and the wide door&mdash;useless precautions
now&mdash;and the flood of moonlight
streamed again into the familiar old hall.
He looked about at the misanthropic pictures,
and the moonlight fell fair upon the
beautiful Venus of Milo in the corner. He<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">[132]</span>
looked again at the old will, and Georgiana
Rutherford&#8217;s note, and Mrs. Dehon&#8217;s visiting-card
lying beside it. Through such
various fortunes had he tended into Latium.</p>

<p>He patted Fides on his massive head, as
the dog walked along beside him. He went
back into the house. It was all his own
now; all his own, and untrammelled. He
called his valet to him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Schmidt,&#8221; said he, &#8220;I am not going to
sit up any longer. If anyone comes, I have
been here and gone&mdash;you understand? I
have gone&mdash;to Arizona.&#8221; Schmidt bowed.
He had regained his imperturbability, and
was fearful of being discharged. An American
servant would have left, and brought
an action for his ducking; not so the obsequious
Oriental. And Austin May took his
candle and went quietly to bed. He had
kept his tryst honorably; he had made due
tender of himself; and by all laws, human
and divine, his three offers of marriage had
now expired.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Our</span> hero sank comfortably into the great
old-fashioned bed, with a sigh of relief that
he could sleep at last in peace. The broad
windows were opened, and the moonlight lay
across the lawn; and from it came the
speech of insects, and of summer birds; far
off, one whip-poor-will.</p>

<p>If anyone ever deserved sleep, he thought
that he did; but this is not a world where
we get our deserts. All night long he lay
awake. His mind would go from his infatuation
with the de Valska to his passion
for poor Gladys Dehon; from the Exmoor
hounds to his engagement with Miss Rutherford.
He was devoutly thankful that he
had escaped them all, and yet the peace he
had expected did not come. He heard the
familiar old church-bell strike two, and three,
and four, as he had heard it in his boyhood,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">[134]</span>
when wakeful for a fishing-excursion, or for
some country ride. What was he to do next?</p>

<p>He could not analyze his state of mind.
The night hours passed, and still he lay
there wondering. The whip-poor-will had
some time been silent; suddenly, as if at a
wave of an unseen baton, the orchestra of
day birds fell to singing. May listened; in
eleven years he had not heard them. Then,
as suddenly, they stopped. And then the
dawn came, one ray of orange sunlight, and
the fragrance of the new-born day.</p>

<p>At last he rose, impatiently, and went to
the wide window. The sunbeams slid beneath
the arching elms and slanted through
the sward. Such scenes had been wont to
make him happy when he was young&mdash;and
when he was in love. This was a strange
mood for him at thirty-three and free&mdash;a
mood of melancholy, almost a loneliness.</p>

<p>Even his cold bath failed to restore him.
He was glad they had none of them come;
he was certain of that. And yet&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>As he was dressing, he opened the closet
door. There was the broad straw hat, with
its pink ribbons, still hanging, faded, on the
nail; and suddenly he recognized it. He<span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">[135]</span>
took it down, and looked at it curiously;
and as he sat there, holding it in his hands,
the great St. Bernard dog came up and
sniffed at it. It was May Austin&#8217;s. And as
Austin sat there, he remembered that he
had loved her.</p>

<p>He walked out upon the lawn again,
brushing the dews upon the grass. Fool
that he was! First loves were best, after all.</p>

<p>But where was she? He had not heard
from her for years. He had never even
written, after the Trouville episode. And
she&mdash;she must have divined that he was
false. First loves were best. Oh, cruel
Uncle Austin! Yet his own wretched
fickleness was the most to blame, after all.
His uncle was a cynic; but he had been a
young man in love.</p>

<p>Of one thing he was sure&mdash;though he had
taken eleven years to find it out. Wherever
she might be, throughout the world, there
he would find her. And he knew now what
had been in his mind, that yesterday, when
he had walked beside the lily-pond, along
the soft path no longer trod by her. Where
could she be? First loves were best. And
he fell into a reverie.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">[136]</span>He was still holding the hat in his hand,
and Fides came up again and sniffed at it.
There was something in his mouth&mdash;was it
a glove?</p>

<p>May took the glove, and almost thought
he recognized it. It was a woman&#8217;s glove,
a garden-glove with a long arm&mdash;where had
he found it?</p>

<p>The dog looked up at him, almost as if
he read his thoughts, and then he led the
way and Austin followed. He went across
the lawn, and through the hedge, to the
well-remembered seat in the orchard, by the
linden-tree, and there he stopped. And
May sat down upon the seat and dreamed.</p>

<p>An hour he sat there, and then he saw a
figure coming through the field. And his
heart told him that this was May Austin.
She did not see him, and he waited there.</p>

<p>When she came out from under the last
apple-tree, he saw her stop and waver. She
was lovelier still than he remembered her,
and he went up to her and took her hand.
She blushed, and he could feel it tremble as
it lay in his.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&mdash;I thought you were abroad,&#8221; said she.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have come back,&#8221; he answered, simply.</p>

THE POSTHUMOUS JEST.</h3>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">An</span> hour later Schmidt was sitting by the
front door, smoking his long pipe, when he
thought he saw his master crossing the
lawn along the lily-pond. But he was
walking hand in hand with a young lady.
The long pipe dropped from Schmidt&#8217;s
hand; and</p>

<p>&#8220;Potztausend!&#8221;</p>

<p>The imperturbable valet was moved to
say as much as this, but of further speech
remained incapable. May approached.</p>

<p>&#8220;Schmidt, you will go to town and get
the rest of my luggage.&#8221;</p>

<p>The valet only stared.</p>

<p>&#8220;And after this I shall not need your
services. I will find you a good place (with
some of my bachelor friends,&#8221; thought May;
&#8220;poor devils!&#8221;). Schmidt still stood there,
his broken pipe upon the door-step.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">[138]</span>&#8220;Do you hear what I say?&#8221;</p>

<p>Schmidt made an effort. &#8220;There is a
letter for monsieur&mdash;in the pavilion.&#8221; A
letter! May trembled to himself once
more.</p>

<p>&#8220;I must go home,&#8221; said May Austin, still
blushing violently. She lived in a cottage
there, near by, that she had bought with
her slender fortune. But May begged her
to wait until he had gone to the pavilion,
and then he would go with her. He feared
that he knew what the letter was. But it
had come too late! A thousand countesses
could not bind him now.</p>

<p>Coming thither, May sat upon the door-step,
and Austin opened the letter.</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="right"><span class="smcap">Law Offices of Vesey</span> &amp; <span class="smcap">Beames, &nbsp; &nbsp;<br />
3 Court Street, Boston</span>, &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br />
August 14, 1886.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Austin May</span>, Esq., Brookline, Mass.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Sir</span>: The eleven years&#8217; delay required by the
will of your late uncle, John Austin, having expired to-day,
I have much satisfaction in sending you a copy
(herein enclosed) of the document contained in the sealed
envelope referred to in said will, and constituting his residuary
legatee; although, as I am informed that you
have never married, the residuary clause of the will does<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">[139]</span>
not take effect. The executors hold themselves in readiness
to deliver over to you all the securities and title-deeds
representing your uncle&#8217;s estate upon receiving
from you an affidavit that you have not, up to date, contracted
a legal marriage.</p>

<p>I have some embarrassment in speaking to you of another
aspect of this case, and can only hope you will
think I acted for the best. You will remember that immediately
after your uncle&#8217;s death, I sent you a copy of the
will as it was filed for probate. But when it came to a
hearing I found that the court utterly refused to allow
probate of a will which contained as a most important part
the contents of a sealed letter, left in my custody, and the
purport of which was unknown to the court. His honor
intimated that he considered the will ridiculous in tenor
and inartificial in structure; and that it was at least questionable
whether the residuary devise was not void, as dependent
upon a condition in restraint of marriage. It was
in vain that I cited the case where a man chalked his will
upon his own barn-door, and the barn-door having been
brought into court and copied was allowed to be replaced
upon its hinges. The court wholly objected to being
made, as it were, a confidant of Mr. Austin&#8217;s love projects;
and insisted that the sealed letter should be opened
then and there, and read to the court, and appended to
the will and filed away with it. Accordingly this was
done.</p>

<p>But I conceived that I should be best following out the
wishes of your uncle and my old friend by not telling you
of this. Suspecting that it would never occur to you to
inspect the court records, the reporters were paid for
their silence, and although you might at any time during
the past eleven years have read this sealed envelope, your<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">[140]</span>
continued absence abroad leads me to hope that you have
never done so.</p>

<p>I am, sir, with great respect,</p>

<p class="right"><span class="indentright">Faithfully yours,</span><br />
<span class="smcap">J. Vesey, Jr.</span></p>
</div>

<p>Austin May dropped the letter from his
hands and looked at May. &#8220;I might have
known it any time these eleven years,&#8221;
said he.</p>

<p>&#8220;Known what?&#8221; said she, picking up
the enclosure, which had fluttered to the
floor.</p>

<p>&#8220;Perhaps it is as well,&#8221; gasped Austin;
and he shuddered as he thought of Mrs.
Terwilliger and the scheming Countess.
He took the paper from May&#8217;s hands and
read as follows:</p>

<p>&#8220;I, John Austin, gentleman, hereby incorporate
this sealed writing, referred to in
my will of even date herewith, as part of
my said will. Having provided in such my
will that in the event of my said nephew,
Austin May, becoming married before he
attain the age of thirty-five, or before the
period of eleven years shall have elapsed
from the date of my death, whichever shall
first happen, all my property, real and personal,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">[141]</span>
except my said bin of Lafite claret,
shall go to my residuary legatee; and having
observed a certain tenderness existing
between my said nephew, Austin May, and
my said niece, May Austin, I hereby nominate
and create my dear niece, May Austin,
as such my residuary legatee&mdash;in the hope
that as I, marrying without love, have been
unhappy, they, my said niece and nephew,
marrying for love alone, giving up all
thoughts of worldly advantage, may enjoy
the blessings of this world besides.&#8221;</p>

<p>The paper slipped from Austin&#8217;s hands.</p>

<p>&#8220;To think that I have waited eleven
years!&#8221; said he. And he struck his hand
against his forehead.</p>

<p>But May Austin looked up to him and
smiled.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Of the Countess Polacca de Valska, Austin
never heard. Terwilliger Dehon remarried,
and, for the second time, a very
pretty woman; such men always do. The
Burlington Quincys have also been married;
and Tom Leigh has come to stay at
Brookline for this season; and Mrs. Eastman&#8217;s
reign is ended; but Fides is an honored<span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">[142]</span>
inmate of the Brookline house. And
if you drive by there, some summer afternoon,
you will note once more about the
windows those frilled and pleated things
that denote the presence of a woman&#8217;s hand.</p>

<p>AN HONORABLE SURRENDER. (16mo, $1.00.)</p>
</div>

<p>&#8220;The story belongs distinctly to the realistic school of modern
fiction. The situations are those of every day. The characters are
not in the least eccentric; the dialogue is never extravagant; the
descriptive and analytical passages are neither obtrusive nor too
prolix. The sum of all these negations is a charming book, full of
a genuine human interest.&#8221;&mdash;<i>The Portland Advertiser.</i></p>

<p>VALENTINO: An Historical Romance. (12mo, $1.00.)</p>
</div>

<p>&#8220;It is well called a romance, and no romance indeed could be
more effective than the extraordinary extract from Italian annals of
the 16th Century which it preserves in such vivid colors. The
incidents are presented with dramatic art. The movement of the
story never drags.&#8221;&mdash;<i>The New York Tribune.</i></p>

<p>A WHEEL OF FIRE. (12mo, $1.00.)</p>

<p>&#8220;The novel deals with character rather than incident, and is
evolved from one of the most terrible of moral problems with a
subtlety not unlike that of Hawthorne. One cannot enumerate all
the fine points of artistic skill which make this study so wonderful
in its insight, so rare in its combination of dramatic power and
tenderness.&#8221;&mdash;<i>The Critic.</i></p>

they reveal themselves in their actions. Mrs. Burnett&#8217;s characters

<p>&#8220;Dr. Holland will always find a congenial audience in the homes
of culture and refinement. He does not affect the play of the darker
and fiercer passions, but delights in the sweet images that cluster
around the domestic hearth. He cherishes a strong fellow-feeling
with the pure and tranquil life in the modest social circles of the
American people, and has thus won his way to the companionship
of many friendly hearts.&#8221;&mdash;<i>The New York Tribune.</i></p>

it is a sea story, all the action is not on board ship. There is a

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
